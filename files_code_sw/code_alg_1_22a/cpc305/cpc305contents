CPC 305 CONTENTS

This CODE component contains the source code for sample algorithms.

TSK001 - Sample Algorithm 1, Digital Reflectivity Algorithm
     An elevation based algorithm producing a final product with 
     packet code 16 (digital data array).  Configured twice with
     individual task names, each using different inputs and outputs.
     Uses super resolution data input.
TSK002 - Sample Algorithm 2, Radial Reflectivity Algorithm
     An elevation based algorithm producing a final product with
     packet code AF1Fx (radial run length encoded).
TSK003 - Sample Algorithm 3, The first task of a two-task algorithm.  
     Produces an elevation based output of a digital reflectivity 
     intermediate product in CVG format
TSK004 - Sample Algorithm 3, The second task of a two-task algorithm.  
     Produces a volume based final product using packet code 16 
     (digital data array).
TSK005 - Sample Algorithm 4, The first task of a two-task algorithm.
     Produces two elevation based intermediate products (simple text
     data). Demonstrates optional input.
TSK006 - Sample Algorithm 4, The second task of a two-task algorithm.
     Demonstrates the 'WAIT_ALL' type algorithm control loop. 
     Produces two elevation based final products (graphic product 
     simple text data).
