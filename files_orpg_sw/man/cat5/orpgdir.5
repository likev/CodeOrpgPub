ORPGDIR(5)             RPG Environment Variable Manpage           ORPGDIR(5)

NAME
ORPGDIR - defines RPG data directory pathname

DESCRIPTION
The ORPGDIR environment variable defines the RPG data directory pathname.

In the fielded software, this environment variable is set to "/data".

In the baselined software, this environment variable is set in one or more
user login environment files (e.g., .profile, .cshrc).

The baselined ASCII system configuration template files typically specify
datastore pathnames in terms of this environment variable.

The following files typically reside in the directory identified by ORPGDIR
(or in a subdirectory):

    - task LogError Linear Buffer (LE LB) files
    - task STDOUT and STDERR files
    - global output files (e.g., intermediate and final product data)
    - Manage RPG files, including:

        - State File
        - LB Alarm Attribute Table
        - LB Datastore Attribute Table
        - LB Product Attribute Table
        - LB Task Attribute Table
        - Datastore Status Messages
        - Task Status Messages
        - Critical Task LE LB Messages

NOTES
Task-private files and/or datastores should reside in the directory
identified by the WORK_DIR environment variable.
