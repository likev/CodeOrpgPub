NAME
link_man_3 - link library man pages to routine names

SYNOPSIS
link_man_3 

DESCRIPTION
 This script generates links for library manpages.
 Libraries may have a single manpage for all the callable routines
 in it.  But for the man utility to access the page when called 
 with the routine names, there must be a link created with the
 routine name pointing to the library.
 For example, the file lb.3 is the man page describing the linear
 buffer library routines, one of which is LB_open.  To get the
 page when "man LB_open" is entered, there must be a link from
 LB_open.3 to lb.3.

 This script should be run in the man/cat3 directory. It is usually
 run by the make_rpg script as part of a normal build sequence.
