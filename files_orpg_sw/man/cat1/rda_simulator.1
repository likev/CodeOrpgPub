NAME
    rda_simulator - RDA simulator.


SYNOPSIS
    rda_simulator (options)


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

The simulator uses a set of disk files that contain the different message 
types written back to the RPG. For the simulator to initialize, environment 
variable "CFG_DIR" is evaluated to locate the message files. The 
default location for these files is "$HOME/cfg". If the files can not be 
found or opened, the simulator writes an error message and aborts.


DESCRIPTION

The RDA simulator is a process which runs on a local machine that emulates the 
basic behavior of a RDA. The simulator interfaces with the orpg process(es) 
through a comm manager so, in conjunction with testing orpg-to-rda interfacing, 
the orpg process(es)-to-comm manager interfacing can also be tested.  Moment 
data is initialized to a value from 0 to 2**8 linearly scaled dependent on the 
maximum number of bins that can be defined for a radial. Bin 0 is initialized 
to 0 and the last bin in the radial is assigned the value 2**8.

Different verbosity levels can be set for the simulator. All information is
printed to standard output except for runtime errors and these are printed to 
standard error.

To terminate the simulator, type <ctrl> c on the terminal window the simulator 
is running on.


OPTIONS

      -a   antenna rotation rate. The default rates are rates that are 
           pre-defined for each elevation cut per VCP. Due to non-precise timers,
           rotation rates are only estimated, and as a result, the faster the
           rotation rate commanded normally produces greater timing errors.
      -c   RDA channel number (range 0-2;  default: 0)
      -i   alternative request LB name
           default: the RDA comm mgr request LB
      -n   set RDA to Non-controlling (default: Controlling)
      -o   alternative response LB name
           default: the RDA comm mgr response LB
      -s   sample interval (selections are 0.5 & 1.0)
           default: 0.95
      -v   verbosity level (ranges from 1-4):
           1 - prints the orpg-to-rda request message types
           2 - prints the current processing state of the simulator + level 1 
               messages
           3 - prints control commands received + levels 1 & 2 messages
           4 - used for debugging. All information described above is printed, 
               plus all moment initialization data and all messages written 
               from the simulator to the orpg are printed.
      -I   set interactive mode allowing user to define, for each base data
           field, fixed values in up to two different regions. Region 1 begins
           at 0 degrees and ends at a user defined azimuth angle.  Region 2
           begins where region 1 ends and extends to a user defined azimuth
           angle.  Any remaining azimuths will use the default data values.


EXAMPLES:

  Specify an antenna rotation rate of 10.0 degrees per second, a sample
  interval of 0.5 degrees, the RDA channel number to 2, the channel control 
  to Non-controlling, and a verbosity level of 3.

  rda_simulator -a 10.0 -s 0.5 -c 2 -n -v 3
