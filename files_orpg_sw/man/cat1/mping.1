NAME
    mping - Detects network connectivity to multipe IP addresses.

SYNOPSIS
    mping [-pvh]

DESCRIPTION

    "mping" monitors the connectivity status to a number of IP addresses by
    periodically sending IP control packets (ICMP) to them. It performs the
    basic function of "ping" except that it monitors multiple IP addresses.

    The IP addresses to be monitored are input from the STDIN and the
    connectivity status is output to STDOUT. IP addresses to be monitored can
    be added or deleted by sending them to the STDIN port of mping. The format
    is "++host_name" or "--host_name" where "++" and "--" indicate respectively
    adding and deleting a host (or IP address) to the monitoring list.
    "host_name" is the name of the host to be monitored. "host_name" can be an
    IP address such as "128.34.45.6". Multiple host name specifications,
    separated by the space character, can be put in the same input. For
    example, "++my_home --your_host ++128.34.45.6" is acceptable. One can send
    input to "mping" any time while it is running.

    "mping" periodically outputs the connectivity status via STDOUT. The format
    is "host_name--qtime host_name--qtime ..." where "host_name" is the host
    name to be monitored and "qtime" is the "quiet time" for the host. Each
    output message, terminated by a line-return character, contains a complete
    list of all host names that are currently under monitoring. "quiet time" is
    the time lapse, in seconds, in which "mping" has not received any response
    from the monitored host. "quiet time" can be "-1" which indicates that
    mping has not yet to be able to determine the "quiet time". The accuracy of
    "quiet time" equals the period that a ICMP is sent to the host. All hosts
    share the same probing period which can be set through the "-p" option.

    Because only the "root" user can send/receive the ICMP in UNIX, the
    executable file of "mping" has to be owned by the "root" and has the "s"
    permission bit set so others can set uid to "root" when invoking it. To set
    the "s" permission bit, use "chmod u+s mping".

    "mping" is designed primarily for being used by other application as a
    co-process. To run a co-process from an application, one can use the
    MISC_cp_* API in the misc module of libinfr. See "man misc" for more
    details.


OPTIONS
    -p	test_period
	Specifies the time period, in seconds, a testing packet (ICMP) is sent 
	to each host to be monitored. The default is 5 seconds.

    -v	Turns on verbose mode.

    -h	Prints usage information.


EXAMPLES
    Example: echo "++osfrpg5 ++lnxrpg3" | mping -p 4
	Monitoring hosts "osfrpg5" and "lnxrpg3" by sending ICMP to them every
	4 seconds..
   
EXIT STATUS
    0:		Terminated normally. 

    non-zero:	Terminated because an error was detected.
