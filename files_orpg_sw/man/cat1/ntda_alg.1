NAME:
        cpc099/tsk001 - NEXRAD Turbulence Detection Algorithm (NTDA)
                        Algorithm Task

DATA IN:
        298 (RECCLDIGREF)
        303 (COMBASE_ELEV)

DATA OUT:
        315 (NTDA_EDR_IP)
        316 (NTDA_CONF_IP)

DESCRIPTION:
        The NEXRAD Turbulence Detection Algorithm (NTDA) Algorithm 
        Task computes values of atmospheric turbulence (eddy dissipation 
        rate, EDR) and associated confidence values for each elevation 
        tilt in a polar radial format.  The product extents to 230 
        kilometers (124 nautical miles) range from the radar at a 
        2 km range x 1 degree azimuthal resolution.  These data are
        provided for external use to support the detection of
        conditions hazardous to aviation.  The product is generated
        for each elevation at its completion.  This product provides
        64 data levels for EDR and 8 data levels for confidence.
        Please refer to the NTDA Software Description Document for more
        detailed information.
                
        Two Intermediate Products are output by ntda_alg and used by the 
        NTDA's Final Product task (ntda_fp) to create radial format
        products for Eddy Dissipation Rate (EDR) and EDR Confidence
        (EDC).
        
        This task is elevation based and, if requested, outputs two
        intermediate products (NTDA_EDR_IP, NTDA_CONF_IP) at the end
        of each elevation.
