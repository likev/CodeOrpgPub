NAME

hci_wind

SYNOPSIS

hci_wind [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_wind" command invokes the Environmental Data Editor task for the RPG.
It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is
part of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks, typically launched
from the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can
be run as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_wind recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The Environmental Data Editor task provides a graphical user interface to
change and modify environmental data.  Environmental data include:  Default
storm motion, hail temperature heights, and environmental winds.  When
activated, the Environmental Data Editor window is  displayed.  It contains a
collection of buttons, status labels, and graphical objects.

At the top of the window are several sets of control buttons.  The "Close"
button exits the task.  If any unsaved edited are detected, a warning popup
window is displayed allowing the user one last chance to save them.  

The "Save" button is sensitized whenever any unsaved edits are detected.  When
selected, a warning popup window is first displayed for verification.  If
"Yes" is selected from the warning popup all edits are saved; winds table,
hail adaptation data, and storm motion adaptation data.  If "No" is selected,
nothing is saved and edits are left intact.

The "Undo" button discards all unsaved edits and restores the display to
the last unedited state.

The "Clear" button removes all environmental winds data from the winds table.

The "Data Entry" button activates the Environmental Data Entry window.  This
window contains several sets of edit boxes for manual entry of environmental
winds, hail temperature heights, and default storm motion data.  A check box is
displayed above the environmental winds table to allow interpolation of data
between input levels (note: Interpolation is only performed when both wind
direction and speed are defined).  The edit box to the right of the "Coded Msg
(PPBB)" label accepts coded significant wind level data.  When a completed
set of data are entered, the contents of the environmental winds data table
updated with the decoded winds data.  Below is a sample coded message and a
brief explanation on its contents.

Changes to any of the edit boxes in the Environmental Data Entry window are
immediately reflected in the graphical display of the Environmental Data Editor
window.  Conversely, any changes to the graphical display in the Environmental
Data Editor window are immediately reflected in the edit boxes of the
Environmental Data Entry window.

The "On" and "Off" buttons to the right of the "VAD Update" label control the
state of the VAD update flag.  The button corresponding to the current state
is displayed with a green ("On") or red ("Off") background.

The "kts" and "m/s" buttons to the right of the "Units" label control the
units of displayed wind speed data between knots and meters per second,
respectively.  The button corresponding to the currently active unit is 
displayed with a white background.

Beneath the buttons are two status labels indicating the date/time of the last
update to the environmental winds and hail temperature heights data.

The rest of the Environmental Data Editor window contains graphical displays
of the environmental data which can be modified using the mouse.

The default storm motion is displayed graphically in the upper right corner of
the Environmental Data Editor window.  A wind barb is displayed along with a
corresponding label.  To edit the default storm direction and speed move the
cursor inside the storm motion box and press the left mouse button.  The
cursor will change to a pencil.  While the left mouse button is pressed, moving
the cursor around the wind barb focal point will change the wind direction and
speed.  Wind speed is based on the distance of the cursor from the wind barb
focal point.  The maximum wind speed allowed is 99.9 kts.

The environmental winds data are displayed graphically in the lower 2/3 of the
Environmental Data Editor window.  Separate graphs for wind direction and speed
are displayed.  In between is a wind barb display (wind barbs displayed at
every second level).  To edit wind direction, move the cursor inside the wind
speed graph.  The cursor will change to a cross hairs shape.  The position of
the cursor with respect to wind direction and height is displayed above the
graph as the cursor is navigated inside the graph region.  To change the wind
direction, select the left mouse button.  To change a range of directions
move the cursor while the left mouse button is pressed.  If the left or right
graph boundary is reached, the cursor wraps to the opposite boundary.  If both
wind speed and direction are defined for a level a wind barb is generated and
displayed between the direction and speed graphs (only every second wind barb
is displayed to reduce overlap).  If the Environmental Data Entry window is
open, changes to the wind direction and speed will be reflected in the winds
data table.  Using the right mouse button instead of the left mouse button
will clear a value or range of values.

Along the right side of the wind speed graph are two labels, "-20 C" and "0 C",
representing the height of the -20 C and 0 C temperature levels, respectively.
Horizontal lines are drawn across both graphs also at these levels.  To change
a temperature level, move the cursor over the label for that level and select
it with the left mouse button.  The height can be changed by dragging the
cursor vertically while the left button is pressed.  To change the temperature
height release the left mouse button.  Changes will also be reflected in the
Environmental Data Entry window.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header files 
"hail_algorithm.h", "storm_cell.h", and "itc.h" for more information on 
how these data are stored.  The default storm motion and hail temperature
height data can also be modified using the RPG Adaptation Data Editor  
(refer to the man page hci_adapt(1)).
