NAME

   init_alert_request - Initialization Task For Alert Alert Request Messages

SYNOPSIS
   init_alert_request [-t mode] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   This process performs alert request message initialization depending on the
   startup mode (see Options).  

   If the startup mode is "startup", this process performs the following actions:

      1)  The ORPGDAT_WX_ALERT_REQ_MSG LB is initialized.  For all possible 
          narrowband line numbers for which alert requests can be defined (1 - 41),
          the alert request message for each alert grid is initialized to no alerts
          requested.  The LB message ID format is XXYY were XX is line number and YY 
          is grid number (either 1 or 2).  If any LB message write fails, this 
          maintenance task exits with non-zero exit code.  The alert request message 
          format is defined in header file prod_user_msg.h.

   There are currently no defined actions for startup modes "restart" and 
   "clear".
