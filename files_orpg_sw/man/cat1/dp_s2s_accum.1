NAME:
        cpc013/tsk010 - Dual Pol Scan-to-Scan Accumulation Algorithm

DESCRIPTION:
        Dual Pol Scan-to-Scan (S2S) Accumulation Algorithm - dp_s2s_accum
	ingests a new Hybrid Scan rate product, QPERATE, and uses an old rate
        grid to produce a scan-to-scan accumulation, DP_S2S_ACCUM.
        The rate grids are in inches per hour, and the accumulation is in
        thousands of inches.

        The accumulation won't be computed if the old and new rate grids
        are too far apart in time. Rate grids with a missing period are
        interpolated or extrapolated as required. All time thresholds are
        algorithm adaptation data.

        The accumulation grid is also sent to the data store DUAUSERSEL.DAT
        for use by dp_dua_accum.

        In case of accidental termination, dp_s2s_accum keeps a data store
        of the previous rate grid at DP_OLD_RATE.DAT
