NAME:
        cpc013/tsk012 - Digital User_selectable Accum (DUA)

DESCRIPTION:
        
        DUA task computes the accumulation during a user-specified time period. 
        Its inputs include user request and the accumulation data from a 
        24-hour precipitation accumulation database (DUAUSERSEL.DAT). 
        The DUAUSERSEL.DAT is queried using the SQL-like API provided by ROC.

        There are two running versions of DUA runing in the system:
        dp_dua_accum (regular DUA) and replay_dp_dua_accum (replay DUA).
        
        With proper configuration and setup, two versions of DUA are running
        simultaneously in system: regular DUA, and replay DUA. 
        The regular DUA version is designed to handle routine, repetitive 
        requests on the RPS list at the beginning of each volume scan, 
        whereas the replay one, to process one-time-request instantly. 
        The regular and replay versions of DUA complement each other elegantly
        in their services.

        It is the job of the RPG system to identify and dispatch the 
        aforementioned two different types of requests to the regular DUA 
        and the replay DUA, respectively. These two versions of DUA are only 
        responsible for waking up upon receipts of requests and doing 
        subsequent processing; therefore, they share exactly the same source 
        code.
