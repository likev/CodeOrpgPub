NAME:
        cpc013/tsk003 - Enhanced Precipitation Preprocessing Algorithm 

DESCRIPTION :
        Enhanced Precipitation Preprocessing (EPRE) Algorithm - This algorithm
	takes Base Reflectivity data, as well as Clutter/AP Pct Likelihood data
	and terrain-based Blockage data, to produce the Hybrid Scan intermediate
	product, which is used by the downstream Precipitation Processing System
 	(PPS) algorithms and products as the basis for the determination of all
 	rainfall rates and accumulations.  It is a replacement for the original
	Precipitation Preprocessing Algorithm, assembling the Hybrid Scan in
	a somewhat different manner.  

	The algorithm works on the fundamental premise that the lowest
	unblocked, uncontaminated sample bin will be used at any {az;ran}
	location.  Starting at the lowest elevation, a given sample bin is
	tested first against a Blockage Threshold, then to see whether it is
	contained within an Exclusion Zone, then to see whether its clutter
	likelihood is less than a Clutter Threshold.  (Exclusion Zones are
	user-defined regions to account for residual clutter due to man-made
	objects such as buildings or wind farms, large tree growth, etc.)
	If all tests are passed, then that bin's contributions to the adjacent
	slots on the fixed, 1 degree-wide Hybrid Scan grid are weighted to
	those slots and, ultimately, if the combined weight of contributions in
	a given, fixed-grid sample bin location exceeds a Weight Threshold, then
	that sample bin's reflectivity is used in the Hybrid Scan.  Otherwise,
	processing continues at the next higher elevation until all tests are
	passed at that {az;ran} location.  At the end of each elevation scan,
	the percentage of fixed-grid bin locations filled in the Hybrid Scan
	is tested against a Full Hybrid Scan Threshold and, if exceeded (or if
	the next-to-highest elevation scan has been processed), the Hybrid Scan
	is considered "full" and is released into the output, linear buffer for
	use by the downstream, PPS tasks. (Note that all thresholds referred to,
	above, are algorithm adaptation data.)
 	
	Compared to the previous version of this algorithm (commonly known as
	"PREPROC"), this version uses higher-resolution terrain blockage
	information in determination of beam blockage; uses AP/Clutter
	likelihood information to identify and remove clutter contamination;
	allows the definition of Exclusion Zones (via adaptation data) to
	enable identification and removal of areas of persistent, residual
	clutter; spatially averages incoming radials into the fixed, 1 degree
	wide slots of the Hybrid Scan, (rather than laterally moving them to
	the nearest slot); and can build the Hybrid Scan "dynamically" by
	accommodating the elevation strategy of any, operational NEXRAD
	Volume Coverage Pattern (VCP), rather than being confined to the
	fixed set of low-elevation angles shared by all the operational VCPs
	in effect to date.

	EPRE also differs from PREPROC in that it performs its own Rainfall
	Identification function off of the fully-assembled Hybrid Scan,
	analogous to that performed by the Precipitation Detection Function 
	(PDF) off of base, reflectivity data.  The downstream PPS tasks now
	respond to this Rainfall Identification from EPRE in determination
	of the start/stop times of precipitation "events" (such as in the 
	Storm Total Precip (STP) product), rather than the determinations
	from PDF.  (Note that the PDF has not been removed and may still be
	used in the determination of the official Precipitation Category,
	the Weather Mode and the Pulse Repetition Frequency.)
