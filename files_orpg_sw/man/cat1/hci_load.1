NAME

hci_load

SYNOPSIS

hci_load [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_load" command invokes the Load Shed Categories task for the RPG.  It
is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is part
of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks,  typically launched from
the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can be run
as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_ recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The Load Shed Categories task provides a graphical user interface to display
and edit load shed category warning and alarm threshold values and display
utilization values.

The Load Shed Categories window consists of a top row of control buttons and a
table containing load shed warning and alarm threshold levels and current
utilization levels for all defined load shed categories.

Selecting the "Close" button closes the Load Shed Categories task.  If any
unsaved edits are detected, a warning popup window is first displayed so the
edits can be saved.

All edits to the load shed categories adaptation data require ROC level of
change authority.  A lock button is provided in the upper right corner of the
window for the user to enter a password.

Selecting the "Save" button results in all unsaved edits to warning and alarm
thresholds to be saved to file.  A confirmation popup window is displayed for
verification.  The "Save" button is selectable only when the window is unlocked
and unsaved edits are detected.

Selecting the "Undo" button results in all unsaved edits to be discarded and
the display refreshed to its pre-edit state.  The "Undo" button is selectable
only when the window is unlocked and unsaved edits are detected.

Selecting the "Restore" button results in baseline (backup) data replacing the
edit copy of the data.  A confirmation popup window is first displayed for
verification.  The display is updated with the new values.  The "Restore"
button is selectable only when the window is unlocked for editing.

Selecting the "Update" button results in data from the edit message replacing
the baseline (backup) copy.  A confirmation popup window is first displayed
for verification.  The "Update" button is selectable only when the window is
unlocked and no unsaved edits are detected.

Load Shedding Category Data
---------------------------

The Load Shedding Category Data container contains entries for each load shed
category.  The following load shed categories are defined:

	CPU	        - The percentage of CPU utilized by RPG processes.
	Distribution    - The maximum percentage of utilization by a
		          single narrowband line.
	Product Storage - The percentage of the RPG products database
		          utilized by non-expired products.
	RDA Radial      - The percentage of unread radials in the input
		          buffer to the process base data (pbd) task.
	RPG Radial      - The percentage of unread radials in the output
		          buffer from the process base data (pbd) task.
	Archive III     - The percentage of the archive products media
		          used.
		  
Each table entry consists of a category description, a warning threshold
object, an alarm threshold object, and a current level object.  The warning
and alarm threshold objects are both editable by the ROC level user.  The
warning threshold must be less than the alarm threshold.  All values are
updated automatically when the window is locked.  The current level object
is color coded based on its value relative to the warning and alarm thresholds.
If the current level reaches or exceeds the alarm threshold, it is displayed
with a red background.  If the current level reaches of exceeds the warning
threshold, it is displayed wih a yellow background.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
