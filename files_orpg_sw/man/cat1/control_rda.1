NAME
control_rda - Manage and Control Wideband/RDA

SYNOPSIS
control_rda [options]

DESCRIPTION

   Manage and Control Wideband/RDA performs 3 major functions:

     a. Manage and Control of Wideband Communications Line

        control_rda is the RPG interface to the wideband communications 
        manager.  All connection/disconnection commands are first handled 
        by control_rda.  At RPG startup/restart/powerfail recovery, 
        control_rda automatically attempts wideband connection. If the 
        wideband fails to connect, control_rda will post connection requests,
        at periodic intervals, indefinitely until either the wideband
        connects or the RPG operator issues a disconnection request.  If 
        after an adaptable number of connection retries the wideband line 
        fails to connect, control_rda labels the wideband line status as 
        failed.  

        If the wideband line connects, control_rda immediately performs a 
        loopback test to check line fidelity.  On a loopback test failure 
        (either loopback timed-out or returned message corrupted), 
        control_rda commands a disconnection of the wideband line, then 
        repeats the connection attempt.  If the loopback test succeeds, 
        control_rda returns the RDA to its previous state if the RDA is 
        in remote control.

        On unexpected wideband failures, control_rda will first attempt 
        wideband line disconnection prior to reattempting wideband connection.  
        This is done in order to "cleanup" the wideband line.

        On wideband line disconnection, the disconnection attempts are 
        repeated up to three times until the line disconnects.  If after
        three disconnection attempts the wideband fails to disconnect, the 
        wideband line is marked failed.  No additional disconnection attempts
        are performed.

        On RPG shutdown, control_rda commands the RDA to standby if RDA in
        remote control prior to disconnecting the wideband line.  Otherwise,
        the wideband line is just disconnected. 

        There are two wideband communications alarms issues by control_rda:
        RDA/RPG Link Broken and RDA/RPG Communications discontinuity.  The
        first alarm is issue if the wideband fails to connect or the wideband
        line experiences an unsolicited disconnection.  The alarm is cleared
        when the wideband line reconnects.

        The second alarm is issued if the wideband line is connected, the 
        RDA is in operate state, data moments are enabled, but no radial 
        messages have been received in 160 seconds (2 minutes, 40 seconds).  
        This alarm is cleared whenever the next radial message is received.

     b. Control RDA

        All RDA control commands are processed through control_rda.  Control
        commands are received via data store ID CPC4MSG messages or data
        store ID ORPGDAT_RDA_COMMAND messages (CPC4MSG are used to support
        legacy applications).  Messages are converted to RDA/RPG ICD format
        prior to sending to wideband communications manager.  RDA control 
        is only allowed if the RDA is not in local control.

        There are several control commands which require special processing.
        The COM4_WMVCPCHG (change weather mode) command first requires 
        control_rda to download the default VCP for the weather mode, then 
        control_rda sends an RDA control command to tell the RDA to use the 
        downloaded VCP on next VCP restart, followed by a RDA control command
        to restart the VCP.

        The COM4_DLOADVCP (download VCP command) requires control_rda to 
        download the specified VCP followed by a RDA control command to use
        the downloaded VCP on next volume restart.

        Finally, for the RDA control commands restart elevation and restart 
        volume, the commands are not processed unless they come from the 
        Process Base Data process (pbd).  Restart commands originating from
        the RPG operator are ignored.

     c. Process Wideband Data

        All incoming RDA messages are processed by control_rda with the 
        exception of the digital radar data message (see RDA/RPG ICD) which
        is processed by the Process Base Data process.  For incoming RDA status
        messages, new RDA alarms cause RDA alarm messages to be written to the
        system status log.  For changes in status, only the changed status is
        reported.  The status messages are written to data store ID 
        ORPGDAT_RDA_STATUS.  RDA alarms are written to data store ID 
        ORPGDAT_RDA_ALARMS.

        For incoming RDA performance data, floating point numbers are converted
        to IEEE 754 standard format.  The performance data is then written to 
        data store ID ORPGDAT_PERF_MAIN.  

        For incoming bypass map data, the data is reassembled from its message 
        segments prior to writing to data store ID ORPGDAT_CLUTTER_MAP, message 
        ID LBID_BYPASSMAP.  Message IDs LBID_A304C2 and LBID_CD07_BYPASSMAP in 
        data store IDs DATAID_A304C2 and DATAID_CD07_BYPASSMAP, respectively, 
        are also updated.  The former message contains flags, the latter contains
        the map generation date/time.  Finally event ORPGEVT_BYPASS_MAP_RECEIVED
        is posted.  

        For incoming notchwidth map data, the data is reassembled from its message 
        segments prior to writing to data store ID ORPGDAT_CLUTTER_MAP, message 
        ID LBID_NOTCHMAP.  Message ID LBID_A304C2 in data store ID DATAID_A304C2 
        is also updated.  This message contains flags.  Finally event 
        ORPGEVT_NOTCH_MAP_RECEIVED is posted.  

        For incoming RDA console message, the message is written to data store ID
        ORPGDAT_RDA_CONSOLE_MSG.
