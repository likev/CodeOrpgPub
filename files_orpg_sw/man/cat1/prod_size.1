NAME
    prod_size - A tool for displaying product size statistics.

SYNOPSIS
    prod_size (options) 

DESCRIPTION

    prod_size is a tool designed for displaying product size statistics on a
    product by product basis.

    The statistics can either come from a third party or can be derived from
    products in the product data base.   If the former, the statistics include
    the minimum, maximum, and average product size in bytes.  If the latter, also
    included is the median product size.

OPTIONS

    -a - All products list (only valid if -s option also specified).  All products
         includes intermediate as well as final products (i.e., products with 
         associated product codes)	

    -s - Statistics are to be read from Product Size Statistics LB.  If this option
         is selected, then any "-v" option selected is ignored.

    -v VCP - Only valid if "-s" not selected, uses the angles for the VCP specified
             to break the statistics down for elevation-based products by elevation.  

    -V VCP - Only valid if "-s" not selected, uses the angles for the VCP specified
             to break the statistics down for elevation-based products by elevation. 
             This is the same as -v except the output is formatted in a way that is
             more conducive to ingesting into a spreadsheet.  

    -d DIR - Only valid if "-s" not selected, reads products from a directory. 
             The products in the directory are assume ICD format and stored in
             network byte order.

EXAMPLES

    prod_stat -v 21

        Queries the product data base for all products with product codes.   Displays
        statistics for each product.  Products which are elevation-based show size as 
        a function of elevation angle.
