NAME:
	mda1d: Mesocyclone Detection Algorithm (1 dimension)  

DESCRIPTION :
	The basis of all mesocyclone detection algorithm is the automated 
 	pattern recognition of an area of rotation in Doppler radar 
	velocity data. Because only the component of airflow directly
	toward or away from the radar is measured, areas of rotation appear
	as a couplet of strong localized opposing flows.

	In order for any MDA to function properly, high quality Doppler
	velocity data are required. As a first step at eliminating noisy
	data, velocity whose corresponding reflectivity values are below
	a preset site-adaptable threshold (0~20 dBZ) are deleted.

	Automated vortex detection starts by searching for azimuthal shear
	patterns in Doppler velocity data. The algorithm is designed to 
	detect cyclonic or anticyclonic shear in either hemisphere. 
	Cyclonic shear in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere is
	characterized as increasing radial velocity with increasing 
	(decreasing) azimuth. 

	The procedure begins by comparing two adjacent velocity
	values at constant range from radar. If cyclonic shear exists, 
	an open or incomplete shear segment is created at that 
	range. This procedure continues for the next two radials,
	and so on, until cyclonic shear is no longer detected at 
	that range.

	The radial convergent pattern vectors are detected at the
	first dimension (1D). Radial convergence is characterized 
	as decreasing radial velocity with increasing range along 
	the same radial. The procedure begins by comparing two
	adjacent velocity values alone the same radial. If radial 
	convergence exists, an open or incomplete pattern vector 
	is created along that radial. The procedure continues
	for the next two adjacent sample volumes, and so on, 
	until radial shear is no longer detected.

	Since the velocity field often contains small perbations,
	the profile of velocity as a function of range through
	a signature will not always be characterized by 
	continuously decreasing radial velocity. To overcome 
	this problem, a look-ahead capacity is used when
	building shear vectors and radial convergent vectors.

        The algorithm has been modified to process the super-res data.
        The change has been delivered in RPG Build 12.
