NAME:
       mdaprod

DESCRIPTION :
        This is the process of the MDA that builds RPG To Class 1 ICD
        formatted products for distribution to external users.
         
        The product mnemonics are MD with its product code of 141 and 
        DMD with its product code of 149. The MD product is volume based
        while the DMD is a rapid update, elevation based product.

        Mesocyclone Detection (MD) Product - 
           
           The MD product is composed of the following three data blocks:
           
           Product Symbology Block:  This block contains the graphic symbols
           which appear as thick and thin circles at the location of all 3D
           3D circulations.  The thick symbol is used for circulations that
           meet or exceed a strength rank threshold (currently, 5).  Those
           symbols are also accompanied by a circulation ID number.  In
           addition, if those circulations are detected on the lowest elevation
           angle or with a base height at or below 1 kilometer, four radial
           spikes are displayed radiating out of the mesocyclone symbol.
           
           Graphic Alphanumeric Block:  This block contains a grid of a few
           of the attributes computed for the 36 strongest 3D circulations.

           attributes for all detected 3D circulations.

        Digital Mesocyclone Detection (DMD) Product -
        
           This product contains a rapid update of the MDA output from the
           last complete volume scan.  After the first elevation of a volume
           scan, features from the previous volume are "extrapolated" meaning
           each feature's azimuth/range position is adjusted using the feature's
           motion, or an average motion of all tracked features, if the feature
           had no computed motion.  Then, features from the current elevation
           are matched with the extrapolated features from the previous volume.
           Parameters of matched features are updated with current volume
           information.  Features that are not matched will be reported at
           their extrapolated positions until the radar scans 3 kilometers over
           the circulation top as computed in the previous volume, then they
           are removed from the DMD product.  With a few exceptions as noted by
           an asterisk (*) in the list below, the DMD product contains only
           data that has changed from the previous volume scan.           
           
           The DMD product is composed of the following data block:
           
           Product Symbology Block:  This block contains the generic format
           data packet, number 28.  This packet is an implemenation of the UNIX
           standard xdr format.  See man xdr for details, however, it is
           not necessary to understand these details in order to interpret the
           product.  The Radar Operations Center can, upon request, provide an
           API to decode the xdr format.  Refer also to file orpg_product.h
           for the C structures that are used to create a generic format data
           packet. 
           
           The DMD product data within the Product Symbology Block has three
           product parameters as follows:
           
   		NAME ; UNITS ; PRECISION OR POSSIBLE VALUES
   		-------------------------------------------
		Average Direction of Tracked Features ; deg ; 0.1
		Average Speed of Tracked Features ; m/s ; 0.1

           After the three product parameters is a group of feature parameters
           for each MDA detected circulation (to a maximum of 100 features).
           These feature parameters are:
