NAME

hci_nb

SYNOPSIS

hci_nb [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_nb" command invokes the Product Distribution Comms Status task for the
RPG.  It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It
is part of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks, typically
launched from the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However,
it can be run as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_nb recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The Product Distribution Comms Status task provides a graphical user interface
to control RPG narrowband communications and display RPG narrowband
communications status.  

When invoked, the task displays the Product Distribution Comms Status window.
This window consists of 6 main regions: control, line status, line control,
line management, line/user info, dial-in user management, and general line
parameter management.

Control
-------

As typical with other HCI applications, a set of standard control buttons are
displayed along the top of the window for closing the application, saving and
undoing edits, restoring from and updating the baseline (backup) data, and
locking/unlocking the window for editing.

Selecting the "Close" button closes the Product Distribution Comms Status
window (and associated child windows) and exits the task.  If any unsaved
edits are detected, the user is first prompted about saving the edits before
closing.

The "Save" button is selectable only when the window is unlocked for editing
and edits are detected.  When selected, a confirmation popup window is 
displayed first so the user can decide whether to continue with the save or
abort.  If the user continues with the save, edits are written to the line user
info LB and/or the user profile LB, depending on which data fields were edited.

The "Undo" button is selectable only when the window is unlocked for editing
and edits are detected.  When selected, all unsaved edits are discarded and
the window is restored to its pre-edit state.

The "Restore" button is selectable only when the window is unlocked for editing
and no edits are detected.  When selected, user profile and line info data are
copied from the baseline (backup) copies to the edit copies.

The "Update" button is selectable only when the window is unlocked for editing
and no edits are detected.  When selected, user profile and line info data are
copied from the edit copies to the baseline (backup) copies.

Since line and user profile adaptation data are required to be password
protected, a lock icon is displayed in the upper right corner of the window.
Selecting it allows the user to define a password level and enter a password.
When the user selects a password level in the password popup window, items
which are selectable/editable in the Product Distribution Comms Status window
are displayed with a gray foreground color.  The fuzzy appearance indicates
that these items are not selectable until a valid password has been entered.
When a valid password has been entered, the items are selectable/editable and
their foreground color and sharpness is restored.

Product Distribution Lines
--------------------------

The "Product Distribution Lines" container displays the status of all
configured narrowband lines.  Each line is represented by a row in the list.
A vertical scrollbar is added if the number of lines exceeds the container
height.  A row entry consists of the following components: line number, line
type, line state, line protocol, user ID, user name, line/user class, line
status, utilization rate, and effective rate.

The line number corresponds to the physical line number assigned to the line.
This number is defined in the "comms_link.conf" and "user_profiles"
configuration files.

The line type can be either "DEDIC" for dedicated lines or "DIALIN" for dial-in
lines.

The line state can be either "yes" (enabled) or "no" disabled.  If a line is
disabled, users cannot use that line to connect to the RPG.

The line protocol defines the protocol defined for that line.  It can be one
of the following:  "X25" or "TCP".

The user ID defines the numeric identifier for the user currently connected to
the line.  If no user is connected, this field is blank.

The user name defines the name associated with the user ID of the user connected
to the line.  If no user is connected, the line name is displayed if one is
defined.  Otherwise, it is blank.

The line/user class defines the class associated with a line or user connected
to the line.  Each line has a default class associated with it.  Class
definitions are defined in the "user_profiles" configuration file.

The line status defines the current connection state.  It can be one of the
following:  "CONNECT" (connected), "DISCON" (disconnected), "FAILED", "NOISY",
"CON PEND" (connection/disconnection pending), and "UNKNOWN".

The utilization rate provides an estimate of how much of the line bandwidth is
needed to transfer requested products during the current volume scan.  For
example, suppose that we are running VCP 11.  It takes 5 minutes to complete
a volume scan.  If a user is connected to a narrowband line and requests a
set of products, the products are buffered until they can be sent to the user.
Based on the defined baud rate for the line, an estimate can be made on how
much data can be sent to the user during the 5 minutes.  The utilization rate
defines the percentage of data in the queue relative to the amount of data
which can be sent during the 5 minutes.  If this value continually exceeds
100%, then products will need to be load shed on that line.

The effective rate provides the ratio of the actual data rate to the defined
baud rate; expressed as a percentage.  For example, suppose the line baud rate
is configured at 14400.  If the real transfer rate when products are sent to
the user is 28800 bps, then the rate will be displayed as 200%.  In this case,
the user should change the baud rate configuration since this will have an
effect on the utilization rate and product load shedding.

Beneath the line status list are a set of radio buttons which are used to
sort the line order in the list.  By default, the "Line" radio button is set
so that the list is sorted by increasing line number.  If the "Type" radio
button is set, the list is sorted by type with "DEDIC" first followed by
"DIALIN".  If the "Status" radio button is set, the list is sorted by line
status.

Line Control
------------

The "Line Control" container contains buttons to control each line.  The user
must first select one or more lines in the Product Distribution Lines list.
One line can be selected by moving the cursor over it and pressing the left
mouse button (the background color for the entire row should change to black).
Contiguous lines can be selected by first selecting one line, pressing the
shift key and then selecting the last line in group (the background color for
all rows in the group should change to black).  Multiple non-contiguous lines
can be selected by selecting a line while holding down the control key.

If the "Reset" button is selected, all selected lines are disconnected.  A
confirmation popup window is first presented for verification.

If the "Disconnect" button is selected, all selected lines are disabled.  No
connection can be made when a line is disabled.  The "Enabled" column in the
Product Distribution Lines list should change to "no" when the lines are
disabled.

If the "Connect" button is selected, all selected lines are enabled. A
connection can be made when a line is enabled.  The "Enabled" column in the
Product Distribution Lines list should change to "yes" when the lines are
enabled.

The "Deselect" button deselects all lines that are selected in the Product
Distribution Lines list.

General Parameters
------------------

The "General Parameters" container contains edit boxes for narrowband
adaptable parameters which affect all lines.  The following parameters can
be modified: connection retries, timeout interval, load shed warning threshold,
and load shed alarm threshold.

The "Retries" edit box controls the maximum number of retries the system will
perform trying to establish a connection to a line.  The individual line
retries value can be less than this but anything greater will be ignored.

The "Timeout" edit box controls the maximum message transmission time allowed
(in seconds).  An individual line timeout can be defined but it must be less
than this, otherwise it will be ignored.

The "Alarm" edit box controls the narrowband utilization rate which will cause
a narrowband load shed alarm to be generated and narrowband load shedding to
occur.  This field can also be set in the Load shed Categories window (refer
to the man page hci_load(1)).

The "Warning" edit box controls the narrowband utilization rate which will
cause a narrowband load shed warning to be generated.  This field can also be
set in the Load Shed Categories window (refer to the man page hci_load(1)).

Line Management
---------------

The "Line Management" container contains information for selected narrowband
lines.  A narrowband line is selected by double clicking a line in the
Product Distribution Lines list.  The information for the line number, comm
manager,  and pserver are not editable.  If a valid password was entered, the
line "Type" can be selected between "Dedicated" and "Dial-in".  If the line
type is "Dial-in", the "Port Pswd", "Time Limit", "Baud Rate", and "Comms
Option" items are editable.  If the line type is "Dedicated", the "Port Pswd"
and "Time Limit" items are not editable.

The "Port Pswd" edit box defines the port password for the dial-in line.  It
must be 4 characters or less.

The "Time Limit" field defines the maximum time allowed for a dial-in user to
connect to the line.  If the value is 0, then the global timeout limit is
used.  The maximum allowed value is 1440 minutes.

The "Baud Rate" edit box defines the baud rate used by the RPG to determine
product load shedding for the line.

The "Comms Option" menu defines the packet size used in sending/receiving
messages for the line.  The selection can be "Yes" (satellite) or "No:.


Line/User Info
--------------

The "Line/User Info" container contains information about the selected
narrowband line.  If a user is connected to the selected line, the users ID
and name are displayed along with the line class and distribution method.  If
the window is unlocked for editing, the line class and distribution method
items are editable.

Dial-in Users
-------------

The "Dial-in Users" container contains information about all dial-in users
defined at the RPG.  If a valid password is entered, selections are provided
to add new dial-in users, modify existing dial-in user properties, and to
delete existing dial-in users.

The dial-in users table contains a row entry for each defined dial-in user.
A row entry consists of a user ID and name label, a password edit box, a
maximum connect time override toggle, a class menu, and a distribution method
menu.  To keep the length of the list more manageable, left and right arrow
buttons are provided for the user to page through the list of dial-in users.
The list is displayed in increasing user ID.  Each page contains up to 20
dial-in user entries.

The "User ID/Name" item is not editable.  It consists of a user ID and its
associated name (enclosed in braces).

The "Pswd" item contains the password.  If the window is locked, the password
is displayed as "****".  To actually view the password one must unlock the
window first.  When the window is unlocked, the password item can be modified.

The "Ovr" checkbox item defines the state of the time limit override flag.
It can be changed only when the window is unlocked.

The "Class" item shows the class assigned to the user.  If the window is
unlocked, selecting the class item presents a list of valid classes which can
be assigned to a dial-in user.

The "Method" item shows the method associated with the selected class.  If the
class has no methods, then the label "N/A" is displayed.  If the window is
unlocked and the selected class has defined distribution methods, selecting
the methods item presents a list of valid distribution methods which can be
assigned to a dial-in user.

Beneath the dial-in table are buttons to add and delete dial-in users.

Selecting the "Add Dial-in User" button activates a popup form from which the
user can define properties for a new dial-in user.  The user ID field must
be defined.  If the assigned user ID already exist, a warning popup window
is displayed informing the user to select a different number.  In addition to
the user ID field, the password field must also be defined.  The class defaults
to "2" and the override flag is off.  The user name field is optional.  To
add the new user data to the local dial-in list select the "Apply" button.

To delete a dial-in user from the list one must first select the password box
corresponding to the user to be deleted.  Next, selecting the "Delete Dial-in
User" button invokes a confirmation popup window giving the user one last
chance to cancel the deletion.  If the dial-in user is deleted, the
"User ID/Name" item for the selected user will contain the string "Record
Deleted".

Any changes to the dial-in user list will not be applicable until the edits
are saved.  Once the "Save" button is selected, the dial-in list is refreshed
and any records marked for deletion will be removed.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
