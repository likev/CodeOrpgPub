NAME
rescue_data - Rescue ORPG data files

DESCRIPTION
   This routine is called twice during the mrpg rescue sequence.
   The first call saves any non-corrupt linear buffers before
   mrpg erases the /data directory. The second
   call restores any non-corrupt linear buffers after mrpg has
   re-created the linear buffers in the /data
   directory. Currently, the save command copies the latest
   installed adaptation archive into the $CFG_DIR/adapt
   directory for re-installation after linear buffers have been
   re-created. The restore command doesn't do anything.
