NAME
    lelb_mon - Prints and monitors one or more Log Error files

SYNOPSIS
    lelb_mon [options] [proc1 proc2 ... procN]

DESCRIPTION
    lelb_mon is a tool for printing the LE (log/error) messages reported by
    application processes. The LE messages are stores in LB files. Refer to
    le(3) for further details.

    The default behavior is to first print any existing messages and then
    dynamically monitor the LE files. When an new LE messages are reported,
    they are printed. Use Control-C to terminate lelb_mon. The processes to be
    monitored are specified on the command line.

    This tool assumes that LE files are named using the default ".log"
    filename extension (See le(3)). That is, the process named "imaproc" has a
    corresponding LE LB file named "imaproc.log". Processes for which multiple
    instances may exist, may be listed with the instance numeral appended to
    the process name, with the process name proper and the instance numeral
    separated by a ".". For example, instance 1 of the process "multiproc" has
    a corresponding LE LB file named "multiproc.1.log".

    lelb_mon prints LE messages on the standard port. Each LE message is as a 
    line of ASCII text in the following format:

    Time Label Process_name Message (n_reps: #) -Source_file_name:Line_number

    "Time" is the message posting time. It is in the format of "hh:mm:ss". The
    message date is printed in a separate line. If a message has the same date
    as the previously printed message, its date line is omitted. "label" is the
    message's type info. It is a word consisted of characters "E", "S" and "G",
    standing for error, status and global messages respectively. "Label" can
    also be a number, in which case it is the message's verbose level.

    "Process_name" is the name of the process that reports the message. If the
    reporting task has multiple run-time instances, the instance number is 
    printed as "Process_name.instance_number".

    The "Message" field is the LE message as reported by the process. If any LE
    messages were dropped due to repetition (Refer to le(3)), "(n_reps: #)"
    appears after the "Message" field. Where "#" is the number of repetitions.

    "Source_file_name" and "Line_number" tells from where in the C source code
    the message was reported. These fields are available only for critical
    messages (See le(3)).

    lelb_mon relies on the GL_ERROR, GL_STATUS and GL_GLOBAL definition for
    printing the "Label" field. These macros, however, are currently defined
    in ORPG level. Other than this, lelb_mon is ORPG independent. These macros
    should probably be moved to the LE level in the future.

OPTIONS
    -n	le_file_name
	Specifies directly an LE file name for input.

    -v	pid,vl
	Changes a process's verbose level while the process is running. The
	process is specified by its process ID, "pid", and the new verbose 
	level is "vl", which must be in the range of [0, 3].

    -d	le_dir
	Specifies the directory in which the LE LB files are to be found. The
	default is to use the value of the LE_DIR_EVENT environment variable,
	if it is defined. Otherwise, the default is to use the current working
	directory.

    -p	poll_msec
	Specifes an alternative polling rate. The default rate is every 1000
	milliseconds. This option only makes sense when using the tool to
	dynamically monitor one or more LE LB files.

    -s	length
	Specifies the static mode - prints at most "length" existing LE
	messages and terminates. A "length" of 0 indicates that all available
	messages are to be displayed. If more than one process name is
	specified, only the first process name will be considered. The default
	behavior is to monitor LE LB files dynamically.

    -h	prints usage message and exits.


EXAMPLES
    lelb_mon mrpg
	Prints all existing LE messages from task "mrpg" and then keeps 
	monitoring any new LE messages. Any new LE messages are printed as they
	are reported. The monitoring is performed by polling the LE file every
	second.

    lelb_mon -n /export/home/orpg/data/logs/mrpg.log
	Monitors the LE file "/export/home/orpg/data/logs/mrpg.log".

    lelb_mon -v 13421,3
	Changes the verbose level of the process of pid 13421 to 3.

    lelb_mon -p 200 mrpg pbd
	Monitors both tasks of "mrpg" and "pbd". The polling time is set to 200
	milli-seconds (.2 seconds).
