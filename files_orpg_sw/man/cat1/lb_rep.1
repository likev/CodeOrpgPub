NAME
    lb_rep - Replicates LB messages in specified LBs.

SYNOPSIS
    lb_rep [-rnsptcCl] [conf_file_name]

DESCRIPTION

    LB_rep copies messages from a set of source LBs to their respective
    destination LBs. It performs both static replication, copying existing
    messages, and dynamic replication, copying new messages when they are
    generated or modified. LB_rep, by default, performs dynamic replication
    without static replication. To stop lb_rep, one needs to send a signal to
    it. Messages in one source LB can be replicated in more than one
    destination LB and messages in multiple source LBs can be replicated in one
    destination LB.

    The source and destination LB names are specified on the command line via
    the -r option. Multiple -r options can be used for replicating multiple
    replication paths. Remote LB names must have the host name (or IP) part
    such as "apple:/tmp/src_lb.lb".

    lb_rep identifies the LBs by their names. Thus one should consistently use
    the same name for each LB. For instance, one should use either
    "local_host:my_lb" or "my_lb", but not both, for the LB "my_lb" where
    "local_host" is the name of the local host. Similarly one should not use
    both "host:my_lb" and "host_alias:my_lb" for an LB name where "host_alias"
    is an alias of host name "host".

    For message queue type of LB, lb_rep polls the source LBs to read any new
    messages and write them to the destination LBs. For remote source LBs, the
    polling can generate additional network traffic. If there is only one LB to
    replicate, lb_rep performs polling on the remote side for improved
    efficiency. For DB type of LB, LB event notification is used.

    The replication is one-way, which means that a change in a source LB will
    be replicated in its destination LBs while any changes in destination LBs
    are ignored.

    For message queue type of LB, multiple messages can be optionally packed
    and compressed on the remote reading side for better bandwidth efficiency.
    See options -C and -p.

    lb_rep can optionally perform byte swapping on messages that are
    replicated. To use this feature, one needs to specify a type (struct name)
    in the third field of the replication path (-r) option. The -t option must
    also be used to specify the byte swapping function name and the library
    file that contains the function.

    If the source LB or the destination LB does not exist or is not accessible,
    the specified replication for that path is suspended. lb_rep will retry to
    connect to them. Once both are connected, replication resumes. If a fatal
    error is encountered, lb_rep terminates.

    lb_rep log messages go to the LE log file. The log can also be optionally
    redirected to the STDERR port. See option -l.

    lb_rep relies on message ids in replication. If an LB contains more than
    one message of the same id, the replication result is not defined.

    The LB tag field for each message is not replicated.


OPTIONS
    -r	src_lb_name,dest_lb_name,type
	Specifies a pair of source and destination LB names. Multiple -r
	options are acceptable. Character "," can be replaced by "-" if there
	is no character "-" in the file names. "type" is optional. It is the
	type (struct name) of the message to be replicated. If not specified,
	no byte swapping is preformed.

    -n	max_static_msg_number
	Specifies the maximum number of messages statically replicated. The 
	default is 0. This applies to sequential LB. For DB LB, if 
	max_static_msg_number is non-zero, all messages are statically 
	replicated.

    -s	Terminates after static replication.

    -p	poll_ms
	Specifies the polling time interval in milli-seconds for dynamic 
	replication. The default is 1000 ms (1 second).

    -C  compress_method
	Specifies a compression method. 0 for GZIP and 1 for BZIP2. If this
	option is specified, for any replication path with source LB located on
	a remote host and destination LB located on the local host, all
	messages (up to 10) to be replicated in the source LB are packed,
	compressed, shipped to the local host, uncompressed, unpacked and
	written to the destination LB. Note that the number of messages packed
	depends on the -p option.

    -t  lib_file:func_name
	Specified the byte swapping function and the library file name where
	the function is to find.

    -l  LE_label
	Specified a label string used in LE messages. This is useful if
	multiple instances of lb_rep share the same LE file. If "LE_label" is
	"stderr", all log messages go to the STDERR port instead of the LE log
	file.


EXAMPLES
    Example 1: lb_rep -r lb1-lb2
	Copies all new messages from LB "lb1" to LB "lb2" as they are 
	generated (dynamic replication).

    Example 2: lb_rep -n 100 -r lb1-lb2 -r lb3-lb4
	Copies up to 100 messages (static replication) first and then continues
	dynamic replication. Here two LBs are replicated.

    Example 3: lb_rep -n 100 -s -r lb1-lb2
	Copies up to 100 messages (static replication) first and then 
	terminates.
   
EXIT STATUS
    0:		Terminated normally. 

    non-zero:	Terminated because an error was detected.
