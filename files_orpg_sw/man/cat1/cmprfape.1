NAME
cpc007 tsk011 cmprfape - Composite Reflectivity Polar Grid AP-Edited

INPUTS
	COMBBASE - RADIAL_DATA

OUTPUTS
	CRPGAPE - VOLUME_DATA, INT_PROD

BASE
	VOLUME_BASED

DESCRIPTION
	The output of this task is a linear buffer with the exact same
	format as the CRPG linear buffer but the reflectivity data has
	been edited for anomalous beam propagation (AP) using the Clutter
	Removal Algorithm (see document NX-DR-03-050).  The Clutter
	Removal Algorithm was implemented in WSR-88D Build 10 RPG and 
	used to create a Low-Level Layer Composite Reflectivity Product
	with AP Removed (product message code 67 and mnemonic APR).  
	In Open RPG Build 1 the algorithm software was modified to be
	used as common modules by this task.  A new main module (cmprfape)
	and buffer control module (A307B1) were written for this task and 
	the following Clutter Removal Algorithm software modules are 
	shared with the LCRAPPG task: A31483, A31484, A31485, A31486,
	A31487, A31488, A3148A, A3148B, A3148C, A3148E, A3148F, A3148H.
	In addition this task includes elements: A3148P2, A3148P3,
	A3148C1, A3148C3 from A314BUF,INC; and A307P4 from A307BUF.INC.
	From A309ADPT.INC this task includes element A3CD70CA to
	register adaptation data SITEADP.
