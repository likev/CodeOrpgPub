NAME

ps_onetime - Schedule One-time Products

SYNOPSIS
   ps_onetime [-v n] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

This is the process that schedules one-time requests and alert paired
products both from the real-time stream and from replay data.

All input to this routine is through linear buffers. User requests may be made 
for the last available product, the current product, or a product
generated at a specific time.  Current products will come from the
product database if it was generated on the current volume, otherwise,
it will attempt to get the product from the replay stream.

Current products may also be requested to be delivered for up to 9 future 
volumes, every 1st to 9th volume. (Refer to the Product Request Message 
documentation in RPG/ASSOCIATED PUP ICD. )

Alert paired product requests are also processed by ps_onetime.
