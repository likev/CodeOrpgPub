NAME:
	mlda - Melting Layer Detection Algorithm

ID:
	2303 - cpc023/tsk003

INPUTS:
	HCA(321)

OUTPUTS:
	MLDA(328)

DESCRIPTION:
	This task takes HCA (321) radial data as input and generates a
	volume-based intermediate product MLDA (328). It has 24 adaptable
	parameters. 

	It collects the wet snow points from elevation angle 4 degree to 10
	degree by using many wet snow filters. After elevation 10 degree or 
	at the end of volume, the melting layer is calculated based on the sum
	of wet snow points collected during previous volumes. The number of
	volumes used for wet snow points summation depends on the weather mode 
	and it is adaptable. If the sum of the wet snow points exceeds the 
	threshold value (adaptable), the real height of the melting layer is
	calculated. Otherwise, the default height is used, which is the zero 
	degree height from hail algorithm.
