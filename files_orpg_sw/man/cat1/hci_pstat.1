NAME

hci_pstat

SYNOPSIS

hci_pstat [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_pstat" command invokes the Products in Database task for the RPG.  It
is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is part
of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks, typically launched from
the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can be run
as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_pstat recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The Products in Database task provides a graphical user interface to view the
contents of the RPG products database.  When activated, the Products in
Database window is displayed.  It consists of a "Close" button, status label,
two drop down menus, and a scrolled products list.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.

The status label to the right of the "Close" button contains the current
RPG volume sequence number and the start time (RDA time) of the current volume.
It is updated at the beginning of each new volume scan.

The button in the "Search Date/Time" container activates a drop down menu
containing entries for each unique volume time in the RPG products database.
When the task is started it is initialized to the latest volume time found in
the RPG products database.  The list is updated at the beginning of each new
volume (new volume time will not show up in the list until the start of the
next volume).  The volume times in the menu are organized in reverse
chronological order.

The button in the "Select Product" container activates drop down menu
containing entries for all unique product types found in the RPG products
database.  When the task is started it is initialized to all product types
found in the RPG products database.  The list is updated at the beginning of
each new volume.

If the currently selected product entry is not "All Products", the volume time
list will contain the entry "All Volume Times".  If the currently selected
volume time entry is not "All Volume Times", the products list will contain
the entry "All Products".  The "All Products" and "All Volume Times" selections
are not allowed together in order to minimize the impact of database queries.
Displaying the entire database in one scrolled window would defeat the purpose
of the two drop down lists.

The scrolled products list will contain those products found in the RPG
products database meeting the criteria defined by the selected drop down menu
items.  An entry will exist for each unique product.  The entry consists of
the product mnemonic, code, RDA volume date and time, expiration date/time,
and elevation angle (if elevation based).  This list is updated at the end of
each elevation scan.  The order of the list is dependent on the results of the
product database query.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
