NAME:
        cpc014/tsk010 - High Resolution Vertically Integrated Liquid (VIL) 

DATA IN:
        297 (DQA)

DATA OUT:
        134 (HRVIL)

DESCRIPTION :
        The High Resolution VIL (HRVIL) algorithm processes the input 
	DQA intermediate buffer reflectivity factor data.  One intermediate
	buffer product is output from DQA upon completion of an
	elevation.  HRVIL uses this to compute partial VIL values for each
	radial gate for the elevation.  These partial VIL values are summed
	until completion of all elevations in a volume.  Upon receipt of the
	final elevation DQA product of a volume, the last set of partial
	VILs are computed and summed with the running total data from the 
	prior tilts.  This final summed product is the total high resolution
	VIL that comprises the final volume output product from the 
	algorithm.
                
	The program hrvil_main controls the algorithm flow.  The computational
	VIL code resides in hrvil_compute_vil.  There the partial and, with
	the last elevation, total VIL by radial range gate is computed. 
	The data are also converted to a digital coding for HRVIL in this
	process.  Lastly, hrvil_symb_layer is used to build the final ICD
	version of this product (data and header).
