NAME
    prod_decompress - Decompresses a given product and produces a new
                      file containing the decompressed product.

SYNOPSIS
    prod_decompress [options] <prod_file_name>

DESCRIPTION
    The prod_decompress tool decompresses a single product.  The tool is
    invoked at the command line, takes the product file name (and path if
    not in the current working directory), and produces an output file 
    in the same directory that contains the decompressed product.
    The output file is named the same as the input file except it has a 
    ".uncomp" extension.

OPTIONS
    -h        Prints usage message and exits.
    -t <file> This is the option used to specify a product tables file
              (product_tables).  If this option is not used the program
              looks in the $RPG_LEVEL/cfg directory for the product_tables
              file.

        working directory.

        working directory.  Note that this time it uses the product_tables file
        located in the specified directory.
