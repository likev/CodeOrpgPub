NAME
    prm - process removing tool

SYNOPSIS
    prm [-m] [-s] [-q] [-f] [-quiet] [ver] [-SIGKILL] [-9] [proc1 proc2 ... ]

DESCRIPTION
    prm kills the specified processes and/or removes the specified shared
    memory segments, message queues and semaphore sets. The "kill" command is
    used to kill processes, while the "ipcrm" command is used to remove shared
    memory segments, message queues and/or semaphore sets.

    The whitespace-separated list of process names indicates that one or more
    processes owned by the user are to be killed. prm relies on command "ps" to
    find process IDs by their names. Note that "ps" on some systems may
    truncate the true process name. In such cases, the truncated name must be
    specified to "prm". prm uses command "ipcs" to get the IPC resource info.

OPTIONS
    -mkey0,key1...
	Removes shared memory segments of keys "key0", "key1" and so on. At 
	most 12 comma-separated keys may be specified. No spaces is allowed 
	in this option. One can this option multiple times.

    -m	Removes all shared memory segments.

    -skey0,key1...
	Removes semaphores of keys "key0", "key1" and so on. At most 12
	comma-separated keys may be specified. No spaces is allowed in this
	option. One can this option multiple times.

    -s	Removes all semaphores.

    -qkey0,key1...
	Removes message queues of keys "key0", "key1" and so on. At most 12
	comma-separated keys may be specified. No spaces is allowed in this
	option. One can this option multiple times.

    -q	Removes all message queues.

    -quiet Suppressing messages.

    -ver Turns on message printing.

    -SIGKILL Uses SIGKILL instead of SIGTERM to terminate processes.

    -9 The same as -SIGKILL

    -fflags
	Specifies "flags" for "ps" command. The default is "-ef" (e.g. -f-ef).
	One can also specify "ps" flags directly if there is no ambiguity.

EXAMPLES
    prm -elf imaprocess
    prm -f-elf imaprocess
	Removes process "imaprocess". Note that these two commands are 
	identical.

    prm -m40001,40002
    prm -m40001 -m40002
	Removes the shared memory segments identified by the keys 40001 and 
	40002. Note that these two commands are identical.

    prm -m -s
	Removes all shared memory segments and semaphores.

    prm -SIGKILL oneproc twoproc threeproc
    prm -9 oneproc twoproc threeproc
	Removes processes "oneproc", "twoproc" and "threeproc" with signal
