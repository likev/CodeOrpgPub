DATA IN:
        298 (RECCLDIGREF)

DESCRIPTION :
        The Radar Echo Classifier (REC) Products task processes the output
        from the REC algorithm task (recclalg) with a target of anomalous
        propagation(AP)/ground clutter.  This REC Product task produces
        two radial format products, Clutter Likelihood Reflectivity (CLR)
        and Clutter Likelihood Doppler (CLD).
        
        Clutter Likelihood Reflectivity is an 11-data level product with
        a range resolution of 0.54 nmi.  The product displays the percentage
        likelihood that the radar is detecting AP/Ground clutter in the
        reflectivity radials.
        
        Clutter Likelihood Doppler is a 12-data level product with a range
        resolution of 0.54 nmi.  The product displays the percentage
        likelihood that the radar is detecting AP/Ground clutter in the
        Doppler radials.
        
        This final product producing task is different than most in the orpg
        in that it receives potentially two different input linear buffers
        (reflectivity or Doppler) and produces its output based on which ever
        input it receives.  Although the REC algorithm task should always
        produce both linear buffers this task will function even if only one
        linear buffer is received.
        
        Besides the main() function, there are four key functions in this
        task.  There are two key functions for building the reflectivity and
        Doppler products named generate_refl_output() and generate_dop_
        output(), respectively.  These functions both call the remaining two
        key functions, build_symbology_layer() and generate_TAB() to fill the
        output linear buffers.  Generate_refl_output() and generate_dop_
        output() are essentially a mirror of each other.  The only difference
        being the Doppler function calls a utility function to obtain the
        maximum likelihood value from four quarter-kilometer Doppler bins in
        order to reduce the resolution of the Doppler radial to one kilometer.
        
        The build_symbology_layer() function constructs the AF1F radial
        format packet as defined in the RPG To Class 1 User Interface Control
        Document.  This function follows the color data level definition for
        each product as defined in the Product Specification ICD.
        
        The generate_TAB function builds the tablular alphanumeric block of
        each product.  This block contains the REC specific adaptation data
        settings.
