NAME:
        cpc013/tsk007 - Data Quality Assurance Algorithm 

DATA IN:
        96 (COMBBASE)

DATA OUT:
        297 (DQA)

DESCRIPTION :
        The Data Quality Assurance (DQA) algorithm processes the input 
	COMBBASE radar moments in two ways.  First, the individual radials
	are checked for artifacts related to constant power functions.  
	Upon receipt of all radials from an elevation, a check for anomalous
	propagation returns is performed.  The combined results form the 
	basis for the output product.
                
        One intermediate buffer product is output upon completion of an
	elevation and used by the High Resolution VIL algorithm.  Future
	algorithms may also make use of this product.  
                
	The program dqa_main controls the algorithm flow.  The artifact
	detection (AD) code resides in dqa_edit_ad.  The reflectivity factor
	data of each radial are compared against a set of constant power
	reference functions to determine if an artifact signature is present.
	The reference function sets are available for clear air and
	precipitation modes.  If AD is noted, the reflectivity factor for
	the radial is set to "no data" or bit value zero.  After all the
	radials for the elevation have been evaluated for AD, the anomalous
	propagation (AP) check is performed.  This check is bypassed if the 
	vast majority of radials had AD.  The AP code resides in 
	dqa_edit_ap and utilizes the three radar moments.  If a range gate
	for any radial is determined to be AP, the reflectivity factor for
	the gate is set to "no data" or bit value zero.  Upon completion, the
	data reflectivity factor data are packaged and output as an elevation
	intermediate buffer for use by other algorithms.
