NAME

hci_status

SYNOPSIS

hci_status [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_status" command invokes the RPG Status task for the RPG.  It is a GUI
based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is part of the
Human-Computer (HCI) family of tasks, typically launched from the RPG
Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can be run as a
stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_status recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The HCI Status task provides a graphical user interface to display RPG status
and alarm data and the contents of the system status log file.  When activated,
the HCI Status window is displayed.  It provides several control buttons and
many status labels.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.

Selecting the "Print Log Messages" activates the Print Log Messages window.
From this window the user can direct all or a selectable number of system log
messages to be printed.  Only those messages with the specified RPG Status 
window filter properties are actually printed.  Selecting the "Print" button
in the Print RPG Log Messages window causes messages to be formatted and
copied to the temporary file "/tmp/rpg_system_log" and activates the
"print_log" script to actually print them.  Refer to the man page print_log(1)
for more information on this script.

Along the top of the status region are three containers: "RPG State", "RPG
Mode", and "Wx Mode".

Inside the "RPG State" container is a label displaying the current RPG State.
The following color coded states are defined:

	OPERATE     (green)
	TRANSITION  (yellow)
	SHUTDOWN    (red)
	STANDBY     (red)
	FAILED      (red)
	POWERFAIL   (red)
	UNKNOWN     (red)
	
Inside the "RPG Mode" container is a label displaying the current RPG mode.
The following color coded modes are defined:

	OPERATE     (green)
	TEST (RDA)  (yellow)
	TEST (RPG)  (yellow)
	UNKNOWN     (red)
	
For additional information on the meaning of the different RPG modes refer to
the man page hci_rpc(1).

Inside the "Wx Mode" container is a label displaying the current weather mode.
The following color coded weather modes are defined:

	MAINTENANCE   (yellow)
	CLEAR AIR     (green)
	PRECIPITATION (green)
	
The "RPG Alarm Summary" container displays the current alarm state of selected
RPG components.  These components are grouped into 3 categories: "Maintenance
Required", "Maintenance Mandatory", and "Load Shed".  These categories are
defined by the RPG Operability Status field in the general status message (see
the RPG associated PUP ICD).  The following alarm components are defined:

       Maintenance Required -> Distribution
			       Archive III Failure
			       Replay Data Base Failure
			       Task Failure
			       RPG/RPG Link Failure (FAA redundant only)
			       Redundant Channel Error (FAA redundant only)
				
      Maintenance Mandatory -> Product Data Base
			       RDA Wideband
			       
		  Load Shed -> CPU
		  	       Product Storage
		  	       RDA Radial
		  	       RPG Radial
		  	       Distribution
		  	       Archive III
		  	       
If an alarm is active the label background color is red, otherwise the label
background is green.  The "Task Failure" label is actually a push button.  When
selected, the Failed Task List window is displayed.  All failed RPG tasks (name
and ID) are displayed.  Note: The only HCI task which is allowed to be in this
list is the HCI Agent task (hci_agent) since it is considered an RPG control
task.  Failed task information used by this task is published by the hci_agent
task (refer to the man page hci_agent(1)).

The region of the RPG Status window below the RPG Alarm Summary container deals
with system log file messages.  The "Message Filter" container contains a set
of check boxes for filtering messages by type and an edit box for filtering
messages by pattern.  The following message types are defined: Status, Error,
and Alarm.  The "Clear" button is provided for the user to clear out any text
in the search edit box.

The "System Log Messages" container displays a scrolled list of color coded
system log messages.  Only messages of the types selected and containing the
search string defined in the "Message Filter" container are displayed.  The
latest message is displayed first and the oldest message is displayed last.
Messages are color coded by type.  Status type messages are displayed in a
normal background color.  Error type messages (those generated with the macro
GL_ERROR) are displayed in a yellow background color.  Alarm type messages are
displayed in one of two colors.  Activated alarms are displayed in a red
background and cleared alarms are displayed in a green background (NOTE: Not
all alarm activated messages have a corresponding alarm cleared message).  The
latest status/error and alarm type messages are displayed in the status and
alarm lines of the RPG Control/Status window also (refer to the man page
hci(1)).

If the user selects a message in the "System Log Messages" container, the
message and other information about the message is displayed in the "Selected
Message Information" container.  The name of the task which generated the
message along with the message, process ID, source file, and source line
of the message are displayed.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
