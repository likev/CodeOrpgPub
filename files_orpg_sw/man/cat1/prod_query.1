NAME
    prod_query - RPG product database query tool.

SYNOPSIS
    prod_query [-sdpftTvewn]

DESCRIPTION
    prod_query is a tool that performs RPG product database search and prints
    the results. It, with -s option, also reads the products from the database
    and stores them in files. prod_query starts the database server if it is
    not already started. Thus it can be used while RPG is shutdown. prod_query 
    only works on the RPG host.

    See example later for how to use this tool.

    prod_query can be used as a template on how to query the RPG databases.

OPTIONS

    -p  product_code[,product_code_max]
	Specifies the product code to query. Default: All product code. If
	both product_code and product_code_max are specified, a product code
	range is searched. Otherwise, a single product code is searched.

    -t  start_vol_time[,end_vol_time] 
	Specifies the product volume time to query. Default: All time. 
	start_vol_time and end_vol_time must be in format 
	"mm/dd/yyyy:hh:mm:ss". e.g. -t 10/16/1994-08:11:51,10/16/1994-08:23:42

    -T  (Same as -t except that the display is reversed in time)

    -e  elev_min[,elev_max]
