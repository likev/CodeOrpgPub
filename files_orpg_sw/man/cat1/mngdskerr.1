NAME
    mngdskerr - manage or monitor for disk errors

SYNOPSIS
    mngdskerr [ kstat_jaz_err_name  kstat_hd_err_name poll_time ]

DESCRIPTION

    mngdskerr is a task that monitors the SunOS kernel statistics using kstat for
    drive errors reported by the device drivers. If a hard error is reported on
    the primary disk a maintenance mandatory media alarm will be generated. If a
    hard error is reported on the Jaz drive the mngdskerr will terminate the 
    archiveIII task causing a maintenance required task failure.

OPTIONS
    It is recommended that the mngdskerr runs without options. By default, the
    kstat_jaz_err_name is set to "sd19,err", the kstat_hd_err_name is set to
    "dad0,error", and the poll_time is set to 15 seconds. 

    If for some reason the defaults are not acceptable, they can be changed on the
    command line. The first command line option is always the kstat_jaz_err_name.
    The second option is always the kstat_hd_err_name, and the third option is
    the poll_time. The jaz kstat driver name may change if it is hooked up to the
    secondary SCSI bus or given a different SCSI id. If this is the case, mngdskerr
    can be started with only one option (the kstat_jaz_err_name option). If the
    poll_time needs to be changed it must remain the third command line option
    and the other two err_name must be included on the command line.


EXAMPLES
    Use the defaults and run in the background:
          mngdskerr &

    Define the kstat_jaz_err_name and use the other defaults:
          mngdskerr sd8,err &

    Redefine the poll_time to 20 seconds:
          mngdskerr sd19,err dad0,error 20 &


EXIT STATUS
    0 or 1:	Terminated.  View the log file for errors.

   supported. Only a stub mngdskerr_lnux_x86.c exists.
