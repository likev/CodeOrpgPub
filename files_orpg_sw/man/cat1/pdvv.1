NAME
    pdvv - The product distribution V&V display tool.

SYNOPSIS
    pdvv (options) line index

DESCRIPTION

    pdvv is a tool for displaying the V&V data generated by the product
    server(s).  To begin V&V mode, it must be turned on (see command line 
    options).  The product server(s) then populate files (one for each 
    connected dedicated user line) with the V&V data.  The format of this
    data is given in header file prod_distri_info.h.  The output files 
    reside in the work directory with name pdvv.#, where # is the narrowband
    line number.

    There are two flavors of output.  The standard output lists product,
    alert, and request/response information on a product by product basis.
    For products, this information includes such things as product generation
    time, product enqueue time (time product placed on narrowband write 
    queue), time in write time, transmission time, product sequence number,
    transmit priority, and product size.  For alerts, the type of alert, 
    the time of the alert, the alert status, and the alert area are output.   
    For request/response messages, information such as enqueue time, time
    in queue, transmission time, product code of requested product, reason
    requested product is not coming, and elevation angle of requested product,
    if applicable, are output.

    The second type of output list attempts to reconstruct the narrowband
    write queue after each product is transmitted.  Information about the 
    products on the write queue such as product code, product size and 
    transmission priority are output.  The total number of bytes on the
    write queue is also provided.

OPTIONS

           respectively.  The line index command line argument is 
           not required.

    -q	Generates V&V output in queue mode.   Attempts to reconstruct
        the narrowband write queue at any instance in time.  The line
        index command line argument is mandatory.

    -h  command line help.
