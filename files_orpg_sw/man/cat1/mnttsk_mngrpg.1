NAME

   mnttsk_mngrpg - Initialization Task For State File Shared Data and
                   System Status Log.

SYNOPSIS
   mnttsk_mngrpg [-t mode] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   This task performs initialization of State File Shared data, Endian value,
   System Status Log, and Baseline Adaptation data.  Initialization duties are
   controlled by startup mode/action.  The following actions are performed 
   for the startup mode/action:

   startup:

      1)  The Endian value is assigned, then written to LB message ID 
          ORPGINFO_ENDIANVALUE_MSGID in data store (LB) ID ORPGDAT_RPG_INFO(4). 

      2)  The State File Shared data (see orpginfo.h) elements
          for RPG operability and RPG alarms are set to commanded shutdown and 
          no alarms, respectively.  The PRF select flag is carried over from
          previous state, if defined.  This data is then written to LB ID
          ORPGINFO_STATEFL_SHARED_MSGID of LB ID ORPGDAT_RPG_INFO(4).

      3)  The baseline copy of adaptation data is updated.

   restart:

      There are no actions defined for restart.

   clear_statefile:

      The LB message with ID ORPGINFO_STATEFL_SHARED_MSGID of LB ORPGDAT_RPG_INFO(4)
      is removed, then initialize according to 2) in the "startup" section above.

   clear_syslog:

      All messages in the System Status Log are removed.
