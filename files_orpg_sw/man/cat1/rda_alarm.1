NAME

rda_alarm - rda alarm message test tool

SYNOPSIS

rda_alarm options

DESCRIPTION

The rda_alarm command provides a mechanism for generating RDA alarm messages
and writing them to the RDA Alarms linear buffer (ORPGDAT_RDA_ALARM).  An
ORPGEVT_RDA_ALARMS_UPDATE event is generated after each new message is written.

options:

-a	Starting alarm number (range 1-800; default = 1).

-f	Frequency of generated alarms in seconds (default = 30).

-h	Display the command line options.

-l	Log message to RPG system log

-n	Number of sequential alarms to generate (beginning
	with starting alarm number and increasing until
	number is reached.  If upper alarm limit is reached,
	alarm number is wrapped around to 1.).

-s	Set (1) or Clear (0) alarm (default 1)

-v	Echo command line changes to stderr

NOTES

It is assumed that this command is to be run in a normal ORPG environment.
The RDA Alarm message data store (ORPGDAT_RDA_ALARM) must exist.  For specific
RDA alarm code information, refer to the RDA/RPG ICD.

EXAMPLES

The following example generates a sequence of 20 RDA alarms in 20 second
intervals beginning with alarm code 220.

% rda_alarm -a 220 -f 20 -n 20
