NAME
    rssd - Remote System Services Daemon

SYNOPSIS
    rssd [-clpnfast]

DESCRIPTION

    rssd is the server program built with the RMT and RSS library modules. See
    rmt(3) and rss(3) for details on how to use those modules. The functions
    implemented are the following:

	The remote version of most LB functions, a set of selected UNIX system
	functions and file access functions.

	A generic dynamically loadable remote procedure call function.

	Event notification.

    For detailed descriptions of the rssd functions refer to rss(3). Refer to
    en(3) and lb(3) for detailed descriptions on the event notification and the
    LB respectively.

    In a typical distributed application environment, an instance of rssd must
    be running on each of the hosts involved. rssd should be started before 
    any other application process can be started. If multiple distributed 
    applications have to run in the same hardware environment, an instance of
    rssd with a unique port number should be started for each application on 
    each host. See rmt(3) for details on how to set the port number.

    rssd starts in foreground and goes to background and continues to run as a
    daemon process after initialization. If a fatal error is detected while 
    it is running in foreground, it will terminate. The log/error messages are
    sent to the standard error port when it is in foreground. They are sent to
    the rssd log file when rssd runs in background. Refer to rmt(3) for further
    information about the rssd log file.

    rssd completes its initialization in foreground. It starts its services
    when it goes to background. Only one rssd can exist on each host for a
    given port. rssd will not start if there is already a version running on
    the port. Note that, if one kills rssd and immediately starts a new one,
    the new one may not start because the termination process of the existing
    rssd may take some time.

OPTIONS:
    -c	config_file_name
	Specifies an alternative configuration file. The default is 
	$HOME/.rssd.conf. Refer to rmt(3), rss(3) and en(3) for how to set up 
	the configuration file.

    -l	log_file_name
	Specifies an alternative log file. The default is $HOME/rssd.log.

    -p	port_number
	Specifies an alternative RMT port number. The default is deduced from
	string $HOME. Refer to rmt(3) for details.

    -n	N_child
	Specifies the maximum number of children available for RPC. The default
	is 64.

    -f	max_nfds
	Specifies the maximum number of open file descriptors in rssd. The
	default is OS dependent. A larger value than the OS default must be
	specified if a large number of event using applications must be 
	supported. See rmt(3) and lb(3) for more details.

    -a	Keepalive_time
	Specifies the child server alive time, in seconds, after connection 
	failure. The default is the system KEEPALIVE timer (several hours).

    -s	Runs without closing the standard input/output ports.

    -t	Runs in foreground for testing purpose.

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: rssd
	Starts rssd as a daemon with default options.

    Example 2: rssd -c my_conf -t
	Starts rssd with configuration file "my_conf" in foreground for 
	debugging.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    HOME	The home directory where default rssd configuration and log
		files are stored. It is also the location for other rssd files.

    RMTPORT	Specifies an alternative port number, group number and home
		directory. See rmt(3) for more details.

EXIT STATUS
    0:		Terminated normally. 

    non-zero:	Terminated because an error was detected.

FILES
    rssd configuration file
	The file contains access permission info. See rmt(3) for details. The
	default is $HOME/.rssd.conf

    rssd log file
	For storing rssd log/err messages. The default is $HOME/rssd.log.

    $HOME/.rmt.port.host=
	The file used by rssd UNIX socket. Where port is the port number used 
	and host is the host name.

    $HOME/.rssd.disc
	An rssd internal file containing the info about disconnected remote 
	hosts.
