NAME
   iti - Initialization Task For Binary Task Attribute Table (TAT)

SYNOPSIS
   iti [-t mode] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   This process performs task attribute table (TAT) initialization.

   If the command line option startup mode is "startup" this process
   performs the following actions:

      1)  The ASCII task attribute table is read (via library function
          ORPGTAT_read_ascii_tbl()).  Each operational executable process 
          has a TAT entry.  The task attribute table name is assumed 
          "task_table" and resides in the $CFG_SRC directory.  If the
          "extensions" subdirectory of the $CFG_SRC directory exists and
          task attribute table extensions exist within this directory, 
          these are also read.
       
      2)  The binary task attribute table entries are written to LB ID
          ORPGDAT_TAT.  There is an entry for each operational process.
          Its message ID is its task ID (which is an element of the TAT entry).


   There are no actions defined for startup mode "restart".

   Options
	-t mode		startup mode.  Determines which initialization actions to
                        be performed.  Supported startup modes are "startup" and
                        "restart".  By default, the mode is "restart".  

	-h		Provides command line help.
