NAME:
        cpc013/tsk009 - Quantitative Precipitation Estimation  Rate Algorithm

DESCRIPTION:
        Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) Rate Algorithm - qperate
	uses elevations of Dual Pol moments and hydroclass data,
        DP_MOMENTS_ELEV, along with terrain-based blockage and exclusion
        zones, to produce a Hybrid Scan rate product, QPERATE. QPERATE is used
        by the downstream Dual Pol algorithms to calculate precipitation
        accumulations.

        Qperate also produces a Hybrid Scan hydroclass product, QPEHHC,
        which presents the hydroclasses used to compute the QPERATE,
        and a Digital Instantaneous Precipitation Rate product, DPRPROD,
        which is the rates in final product format. Qperate differs from the
        PPS in that Clutter and AP likelihood are encoded in the hydroclass.

	The algorithm works on the premise that the lowest unblocked, not in
        an exclusion zone, sample (azimuth, radial) bin that does not have a
        hydroclass of ground clutter or unknown can be used to calculate a
        rate. Starting at the lowest elevation, a given sample bin is tested
        against a blockage threshold, to see if it is contained within an
        exclusion zone, and then to see if its hydoclass is ground clutter
        or unknown.

        If these tests are passed, a rainfall rate based on the hydroclass is
        calculated using the Dual Pol moments. Unlike the PPS, averaging of
        adjacent bins is not done. If a rate cannot be calculated, the sample
        bin is added to a linked list of unfilled bins for processing at the
        next higher elevation.

        At the end of each elevation scan, the percentage of filled bins is
        compared to a full Hybrid Scan threshold and, if exceeded (or if the
        next-to-highest elevation has been processed), the Hybrid Scan is
        considered complete and the QPERATE buffer is released for use by the
        downstream tasks. All thresholds are algorithm adaptation data.
 	
        For the convenience of the downstream accumulation tasks, qperate
        also maintains the start time of precipitation, the last time of
        precipitation, and whether a storm is active.
