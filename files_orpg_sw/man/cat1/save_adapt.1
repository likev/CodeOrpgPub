NAME
    save_adapt - Save RPG adaptation data so it can be restored later.

SYNOPSIS
    save_adapt [options]

DESCRIPTION
    Saves the RPG adaptation data of the specified redundant channel into an
    archive file and puts it in $CFG_DIR/adapt/installed on the machine where
    mrpg runs. This command also removes all existing adapt archive files in
    it. If a local destination dir is specified with the -D, -f or -c, option,
    the archive file is also copied to that dir. This command can be invoked 
    on any of the connected nodes (mscf, rpg1 etc).

Options
    -D dir (Specifies the directory where the RPG adapt archive file is
       copied to. Default: Not copied)
    -o channel (rpg1 or rpg2. Default: The RPG on the local host. If the
       local host is not an RPG node, rpg1 is assumed)
    -c (Save the adaptation data to the CD on the local host)
    -f (Save the adaptation data to the diskette on the local host)
    -r (Remove all files on the floppy or CD before saving the data)
    -q (Quiet mode)
    -h (Print usage info)

EXAMPLES

    save_adapt

    Saves the RPG adaptation data on the local node, if the local machine is an
    RPG processing node (e.g. rpg1 or rpg2). If the local host is not an rpg
    node (e.g. mscf), channel 1 adaptation data is saved. The archive is saved
    in $CFG_DIR/adapt/installed on the rpg node.

    save_adapt -D .

    The same as the previous example except that the archive is also copied to
    the current directory on the local machine where the command is invoked.

    save_adapt -f

    The same as the previous example except that the archive is also copied to
    the floppy on the local machine where the command is invoked.

    save_adapt -o rpg1

    Saves channel 1 RPG adaptation data in $CFG_DIR/adapt/installed on the
    rpg node. This can be run on any of the processing node. To save
    channel 2, replace "-o rpg1" with "-o rpg2".

    save_adapt -o rpg1 -D .

    The same as the previous example except that the archive is also copied to
    the current directory on the local machine where the command is invoked.

    save_adapt -o rpg1 -c

    The same as the previous example except that the archive is also copied to
    the CD on the local machine where the command is invoked.
