NAME

hci_basedata

SYNOPSIS

hci_basedata [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_basedata" command invokes the RPG Base Data Display task for the RPG.
It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is
part of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks.  It's main purpose
is to view dealiased radar data which are being used as input to the various
RPG algorithms.  It is typically launched from the RPG Control/Status task
(refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can be run as a stand-alone
application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_basedata recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-iconic       Launch the task in an iconic state
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      RPG data stores.
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name ,title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate
		
OVERVIEW

The RPG Base Data Display task provides a graphical user interface to display 
dealiased radial data that are used as input to RPG algorithms.  When
activated, the RPG Base Data Display window is displayed.  It consists of a
set of control buttons and a data display area.

Control Buttons
---------------

All control buttons are located along the left side of the RPG Base Data
Display window.  A "Close" button is located in the upper left corner.
Selecting it exits the hci_basedata task.

Beneath the "Close" button is a label displaying the currently active VCP and
a set of elevation scan control buttons; a "Scan" button and buttons for each
unique elevation angle in the current VCP.  The currently active elevation scan
control button is displayed with a white background.  The "Scan" button sets
the basedata display mode to dynamic.  In dynamic mode, dealiased radial data
are displayed as soon as they are written to the basedata data store.  The
other elevation scan control buttons display the latest complete elevation
scan corresponding to the button angle using data from the replay database.
If data for a selected scan is not available, the message "Product Not
Available" is displayed in the data display area.

Below the elevation scan control buttons is the "Data Range" button.  Selecting
this button activates the Set Data Range window.  The Set Data Range window
contains a set of scale widgets which are used to define the display range
of the data which are displayed in the data display area of the RPG Base Data
Display window.  A pair of slider bars are defined for each data moment; one
to set the minimum and the other the maximum data display value.  To modify a
range, select and drag the block inside the slider bar.  The new value is
displayed above the block.  To make changes active, select the "Activate"
button.

Below the "Data Range" button are five sets of radio buttons: "Filter",
"Moment", "Grid", "Map", and "Mode".

The "Filter" set is used to control whether data below the minimum data
range are displayed in the background color or assigned the color of the
minimum color category.  Selecting the "On" radio button activates the
filter and assigns the background color to all data values below the minimum
data threshold.

The "Moment" set defines the moment which is displayed in the data display
area.  The moments which are defined are: reflectivity (R), velocity (V), and
spectrum width (W).  By default, reflectivity is set.

The "Grid" set controls the display of a polar grid over the radar data
displayed inside the data display area.  If the "On" radio button is selected
a grid is displayed.  In dynamic mode, the grid is displayed at the start of
each new elevation scan and is overwritten as radar data are displayed.  In
static mode, the grid is displayed after the radar data are displayed.  By
default, "On" is set.

The "Map" set controls whether a geopolitical map is displayed inside the data
display area.  This function is not available at this time.  By default, "Off"
is set.

The "Mode" set controls the mode of the mouse buttons when the cursor is
located inside the data display area.  If the "Raw" radio button is set
(default), the mouse buttons have the following behavior:

	Left:   Interrogate the data value at the selected location
	Middle: No action
	Right:  No action

The location (azimuth degrees, range nautical miles), height (feet AGL)m, and
raw data value (dBZ for reflectivity data and knots for velocity and spectrum
width) are displayed beneath the radar display.

If the "Zoom" radio button is set, the mouse buttons have the following
behavior:

	Left:   Magnify by a factor of 2 and use location as new display
		center.
	Middle: Use location as new display center
	Right:  Magnify by a factor of 1/2 and use location as new display
		center.
		
The minimum zoom factor is 1:1 (default) and the maximum zoom factor is 32:1.
If the display mode is dynamic, only new scan data are displayed (any previous
data displayed for the scan are not redisplayed).  In static mode, the entire
scan is redisplayed.

The data display area consists of a scan label at the top, data region, a color
bar, and status information at the bottom.  The scan label consists of the
data type, elevation angle, and start of scan time.  The data region consists
of radar data and overlay data.  The color bar consists of 16 unique colors
which map to a standard 16 color base product (NOTE: no distinction is made
between precipitation and clear air modes.  The color corresponds to product
code 19).  Since the user can define the data range for these colors using the
Set Data Range window, the meaning of these colors may be different from the
corresponding 16 color base product generated by the RPG.

The status information is dependent on the mode defined by the "Mode" radio
buttons.  If the mode is "Raw", only the left mouse button is active inside
the data display area.  Selecting the left mouse button while the cursor is 
inside the data display area causes the cursor position, with respect to the
radar, to be displayed along with the data value of the bin closest to the
selected location, and its computed height (AGL).  If the mode is "Zoom", all
three mouse buttons are active.

At the top of the RPG Base Data display window is a text label describing the
currently selected moment, elevation scan, and elevation scan start time.  If
the display mode is dynamic, the contents of the label are defined at the
beginning of the elevation scan (all fields will be 0 until a new elevation
scan is started).

The RPG Base Data Display window can be resized by selecting a window corner
and dragging the mouse.  Objects inside the window are redisplayed as soon as
the left mouse button is released.

NOTES

When in dynamic mode, radial data are read from the real-time dealiased
radar data store.  In static mode, data are read from the replay database.
Radial data in the replay database are updated only after completion of an
elevation cut.  NOTE: Data from split scans are combined into a single
radial.

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
