NAME:
        cpc013/tsk011 - Dual Pol Long Term Accumulation Algorithm

DESCRIPTION:
        Dual Pol Long Term (LT) Accumulation Algorithm - dp_lt_accum
	ingests a scan-to-scan accumulation buffer, DP_S2S_ACCUM,
        and outputs five long term accumulation grids: hourly
        (bias applied and unbiased), storm total (bias applied),
        hourly difference with PPS, and storm total difference with PPS.
        All five long term grids are placed in the DP_LT_ACCUM buffer,
        which is used by the dp_precip_4bit and dp_precip_8bit tasks to
        build final products. All five long term accumulation grids are
        in thousandths of inches.

        To compute the hourly accumulations (bias applied and unbiased)
        dp_lt_accum maintains a circular queue of accumulations. If the
        new accum grid has precipitation, it is added to the back of the
        queue, and accumulation buffers are subtracted from the front of
        the queue to trim the accumulations to an hour. The first accumulation
        grid may be interpolated to bring the accumulation to exactly an hour.

        To compute the (bias applied) storm accumulation dp_lt_accum adds
        the new accumulation grid to the running storm total.

        To compute the hourly and storm (DP - PPS) difference grids, the PPS
        HYADJSCN buffer is read and converted to Dual Pol resolution and units.
        A circular queue, identical to the one used by the hourly accumulation,
        is used to trim the hourly difference accumulation to exactly one hour.

        All accumulation thresholds are algorithm adaptation data.

        In case of abnormal termination, dp_lt_accum keeps a data store
        backup of the hourly accumulation buffers at DP_HRLY_ACCUM.DAT and
        DP_DIFF_ACCUM.DAT, and a data store backup of the storm accumulation
        buffers at DP_STORM_BACKUP.DAT. The circular queues are backed up in
        DP_HRLY_BACKUP.DAT
