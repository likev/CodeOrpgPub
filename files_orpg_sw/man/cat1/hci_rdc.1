OVERVIEW

The RDA Control/Status task provides a graphical user interface to display RDA
status and send control commands to the RDA.  When activated, the RDA
Control/Status window is displayed.  It contains a row of control buttons
across the top and sets of status labels and radio buttons.

Control Buttons
---------------

Selecting the "Close" button closes the RDA Control/Status task.

Selecting the "Get Status" button results in a command being sent to the RDA
requesting new RDA status.  A feedback message is displayed in the feedback 
line of the RPG Control/Status window when the command is sent.  When the
requested RDA status message is received, the message "Requested RDA Status
Data is Available" is displayed in the status line of the RPG Control/Status
window.  This command is selectable only when the RDA/RPG wideband link is
connected.

Selecting the "RDA Alarms" button activates the RDA Alarms window.  This button
is selectable regardless of the RDA/RPG wideband link status.  See the man
page hci_rda(1) for more information on the RDA Alarms window.

Selecting the "Moments" button activates the Moments window.  The Moments
window contains selections to change which moments are active at the RDA.  When
the window is first activated, the check boxes associated with the currently
active moments are set.  To send a command to the RDA to change moments,
select the "Apply" button.  A confirmation popup window is first displayed for
verification.  If the RDA/RPG wideband link is not connected or if the RDA is
in local control, the "Moments" button is desensitized and the Moments window
will not be displayed.

Selecting the "VCP" button activates the VCP Control window.  Refer to the man
page hci_vcp(1) for more information.

If the site configuration is FAA redundant or if spot blanking is installed, a
lock button is displayed in the upper right corner of the RDA Control/Status
window.  This lock is only applicable to spot blanking and channel control.

RDA State
---------

The "RDA State" container contains a label indicating the current RDA status
and a set of 5 radio buttons for changing the RDA state.  The following RDA
states are defined:  "Standby", "Operate", "Offline Operate", "Restart", and
"Playback".  If the RDA control state is local, all of the radio buttons are
desensitized.  If the RDA control state is not local, all radio buttons are
sensitized except the one  corresponding to the current RDA state.  Whenever a
radio button is selected, a warning popup window is first displayed for
verification.  If the RDA/RPG wideband link is not connected, the status label
is displayed as "Unknown" and all radio buttons are desensitized.

RDA Control
-----------

The "RDA Control" container consists a label indicating the current RDA control
state and a set of 2 radio buttons for changing the RDA control state.  The
following RDA control states are defined: "Enable Local (RDA)" and "Select
Remote "(RPG)".  If the RDA control state is local, the "Enable Local (RDA)" 
radio button is desensitized and the "Select Remote (RPG)" radio button
sensitized.  If the RDA control state is not local, the "Select Remote (RPG)"
radio button is desensitized and the "Enable Local (RDA)" radio button is
sensitized.  Whenever a radio button is selected, a warning popup window is
first displayed for verification.  If the RDA/RPG wideband link is not
connected, the status label is displayed as "Unknown" and all radio buttons are
desensitized.

RDA Power Source
----------------

The "RDA Power Source" container consists of a label indicating the current
RDA power source and 2 radio buttons for changing the RDA power source.  The
following RDA power source states are defined:  "Utility" and "Auxiliary".  If
the RDA control state is local, both radio buttons are desensitized.  If the
RDA control state is not local and the current power source is "Utility", the
"Auxiliary" radio button is sensitized and the "Utility" radio button
desensitized.  If the RDA control state is not local and the current power
source is "Auxiliary", the "Utility" radio button is sensitized and the
"Auxiliary" radio button desensitized.  Whenever a radio button is selected,
a warning popup window is first displayed for verification.  If the RDA/RPG
wideband link is not connected, the status label is displayed as "Unknown"
and all radio buttons are desensitized.

Interference Suppr.
-------------------

The "Interference Suppr." container consists of a status label indicating the
current state of the Interference Suppression Unit (ISU) and 2 radio buttons
to enable/disable the Interference Suppression Unit (ISU).  The following
ISU control states are defined: "Enabled" and "Disabled".  If the RDA control
state is local, both buttons are desensitized.  If the RDA control state is
not local and the ISU is enabled, the "Disabled" radio button is sensitized and
the "Enabled" radio button is desensitized.  If the RDA control state is not
local and the ISU is disabled, the "Enabled" radio button is sensitized and the
"Disabled" radio button desensitized.  Whenever a radio button is selected, a
warning popup window is first displayed for verification.  If the RDA/RPG
wideband link is not connected, the status label is displayed as "Unknown"
and all radio buttons are desensitized.

Calibration
-----------

The "Calibration" container consists of a status label indicating the current
reflectivity calibration mode and 2 radio buttons, "Automatic" and "Manual",
to control the RDA calibration control state.  The following calibration
control states are defined:  "Automatic" and "Manual".  If the RDA 
control state is local, all radio buttons are desensitized.  If the RDA control
state is not local and the RDA calibration control state is automatic, the
"Manual" radio button is sensitized and the "Automatic" radio button is
desensitized.  If the "Manual" radio button is selected, the Refl Calib window
is activated.  From it one can define a manual calibration in the range -10 to
+10 dB in 0.25 dB increments.  To command the RDA to use the manual calibration
select the "Activate" button.  If the RDA control state is not local and the
calibration control state is manual, both radio buttons are sensitized  (NOTE:
The "Manual" radio button is still sensitized to allow the user to change the
calibration value).  Whenever a radio button is selected, a warning popup
window is first displayed for verification.  If the RDA/RPG wideband link is
not connected, the status label is displayed as "Unknown" and all radio buttons
are desensitized.

Spot Blanking Status

is displayed.  The "Redundant Control" container consists of 4 status labels 
and 2 radio buttons to change the control state of the current channel.  The 4
status labels are used to display the current local and redundant control
states (either "Controlling" or "Non-controlling") and the time of the last
redundant adaptation data update on each channel.  If the two times do not
match, they are displayed with a red background.  If the RDA control state is
local, both radio buttons are desensitized.  If the RDA control state is not
local and the local redundant state is controlling, the "Non-controlling" radio
button is sensitized and the "Controlling" radio button desensitized.  If the
RDA control state is not local and the local redundant state is non-controlling,
the "Controlling" radio button is sensitized and the "Non-controlling" radio
button desensitized.  Whenever a radio button is selected, a warning popup
window is first displayed for verification.  If the RDA/RPG wideband link is
not connected, the status label is displayed as "Unknown" and all radio buttons
are desensitized.

Miscellaneous RDA Status
------------------------

Beneath the control containers are sets of status labels.  These status labels
correspond to additional status information contained in the latest RDA status
message.  The following additional RDA status information are reported:  RDA
operational mode, control authority, transmitter power, calibration correction,
interference rate, and enabled moments.  If the RDA/RPG link is not connected,
all status fields are blank.  If the RDA/RPG link is connected, the operational
mode can be one of the following: "Operational", "Maintenance", and "Unknown".
If the RDA/RPG link is connected, the control authority can be one of the
following: "Local Requested", "Remote Enabled", and "No Action".  If the
RDA/RPG link is connected, the transmitter power (in watts) is displayed.  If
the RDA/RPG link is connected, the calibration correction (in dB) is displayed.
If the RDA/RPG link is connected, the moments enabled state can be one of the
following: "R", "RV", "RW", "RVW", "V", "VW", and "W".  "R" corresponds to
reflectivity, "V" to radial velocity, and "W" to spectrum width.

NOTES

In FAA and NWS redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the
window title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
