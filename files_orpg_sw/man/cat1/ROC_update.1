NAME
    ROC_update
    
SYNOPSIS
    ROC_update [-v,l,h]
    
DESCRIPTION

    ROC_update performs the following functions:

	a. Attempts to install any SUN patches included on a CD (or in a
	   user-specified directory)

	b. Attempts to install any ROC custom patches included on a CD (or in
	   a user-specified directory)

	c. For ROC custom patches, manipulates a version bookkeeping file
	   that keeps up with installed patches

    Once ROC_update is called, the default behavior is to install all
    versions of patches on a CD starting with the earliest version.
    SUN patches are installed first, followed by ROC custom patches. If
    an error is encountered, all patches for that version and category
    (SUN or ROC) are uninstalled and the script exits.

    Run-time output is logged to various log files. If an error occurs,
    the affected log files are displayed to the terminal for review. This
    information should be written/copied/attached to any correspondence
    with the ROC.

    ROC_update is designed to be as non-interactive as possible. Once the
    ROC_update command is issued, no other interaction is needed with one
    exception. If the patches are not located on a CD, the user needs
    to provide an alternate path.

    ROC_update expects a certain directory structure. At the top level of
    the CD (or user-specified directory path) should be directories
    containing a version's worth of patches. Hereafter, these directories
    will be referred to as "version directories". Version directories
    don't follow a pre-defined naming convention, save the fact the
    version order should follow the alphanumeric order of the directory names.
    For example, the name of the first version directory should be
    alphanumerically less than the name of the second version directory and
    so on.

    Inside each version directory should be a directory named SUNpatch (if
    SUN patches are to be installed) and/or ROCpatch (if ROC custom patches
    are to be installed). If a version directory is missing one of these
    directories, it is assumed there are no patches from that category
    to be installed. Patches in a directory not named SUNpatch or ROCpatch
    will be ignored.


    For SUN patches:

    Inside each SUNpatch directory is a text file (named patchlist), and
    directories containing patches to install. Patchlist contains a list
    of patches to install (one per line, commented lines beginning with # are
    ignored). It is assumed that each patch listed in the patchlist file is
    located in the same directory. The patches are installed in the order
    they are listed.

    If an error occurs, the patches in the patchlist file are removed in
    reverse order, error messages are displayed to the screen, and ROC_update
    exits.

    ~roc/.SUNpatch.log is the log file for SUN patch installation/removal. If
    an error occurs, the log file's contents are displayed to the screen for
    review. Directories containing patches don't follow a pre-defined
    naming convention. However, it is strongly urged that the original SUN
    naming convention (patch number, dash, version number) be kept because
    of SUN's internal patch bookkeeping database. Regardless of naming
    convention, the names of patch directories should match entries in the
    patchlist file. The contents of each patch directory are assumed to
    follow standard SUN protocol, and will therefore not be discussed further.


    For ROC patches:

    Inside each ROCpatch directory is a text file (named patchlist), and
    directories containing patches to install. Patchlist contains a list
    of patches to install (one per line, commented lines beginning with # are
    ignored). It is assumed that each patch listed in the patchlist file is
    located in the same directory. The patches are installed in the order
    they are listed.

    If an error occurs, the patches in the patchlist file are removed in
    reverse order, error messages are displayed to the screen, and ROC_update
    exits.

    ~roc/.ROCpatch.log is the log file for ROC patch installation/removal. If
    an error occurs, the log file's contents are displayed to the screen for
    review. Directories containing patches don't follow a pre-defined
    naming convention. Regardless of naming convention, the names of patch
    directories should match entries in the patchlist file.

    Inside each directory containing a ROC custom patch should be two scripts
    and a text file. The scripts are named INSTALL and UNINSTALL and
    are responsible for actually doing the patch install/removal. It is the
    responsibility of each script to do whatever is necessary to install/remove
    the patch and verify success/failure. Each script should return zero if
    successful, and non-zero if unsuccessful. The text file is named INFO and
    contains one line of information for the patch. This information is stored
    in a database file and used to check if the patch is currently installed.
    The information line in INFO must begin with the string token VERSION:,
    followed by a space, followed by the version number. Commented lines
    (lines beginning with #) are ignored. Any uncommented lines past the 
    first uncommented line are ignored as well.
