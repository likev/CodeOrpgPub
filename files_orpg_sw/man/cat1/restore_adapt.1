NAME
    restore_adapt - Restore RPG adaptation data.

SYNOPSIS
    restore_adapt [options]

DESCRIPTION
    Restores the RPG adaptation data by searching an archive file in the
    specified local directory, or on the local CD or floppy, and puts it in
    $CFG_DIR/adapt on the specified RPG (rpg1 or rpg2). All existing archive
    files in $CFG_DIR/adapt and $CFG_DIR/adapt/installed are removed. This
    command can be invoked on any of the connected nodes (mscf, rpg1 etc). Any
    RPG archive that does not match the radar site, the RPG adapt version
    number or the redundant channel, is not restored.

Options
    -D dir (Specifies the directory where the RPG adapt archive files are
       stored. Default: The current directory.)
    -c (Restore adapt from CD)
    -f (Restore adapt from floppy)
    -o channel (rpg1 or rpg2. Default: The RPG on the local host. If the
       local host is not an RPG node, rpg1 is assumed.)
    -d date (The date, in format mm/dd/yyyy, of the archive to restore.
	     Default: Todays date.)
    -t time (The time, in format hh:mm:ss, of the archive to restore.
	     Default: The current time.)
       Note: If date is specified but time is not, the latest archive of
	     the specified date is restored. Otherwise, the archive
	     closest to the specified time is restored.
    -q (Quiet mode)
    -h (Print usage info)

EXAMPLES

    restore_adapt -D .

    Searches for the latest RPG adaptation archive in the current directory and
    restores RPG channel 1 adaptation data. This command can be invoked on any
    of the RPG nodes, e.g. mscf, bdds, rpg1 except rpg2. If this is invoked on
    rpg2, it restores adaptation data on RPG channel 2.

    restore_adapt -c

    Restores RPG channel 1 adaptation data from the CD on the local host. This
    command can be invoked on any of the RPG nodes, e.g. mscf, bdds, rpg1
    except rpg2. If this is invoked on rpg2, it restores adaptation data on RPG
    channel 2.

    restore_adapt -D . -o rpg1

    Restores RPG channel 1 adaptation data from an archive in the current
    directory. This command can be invoked on any of the RPG processing nodes,
    e.g. mscf, bdds, rpg1 and rpg2.

    restore_adapt -f -o rpg2

    Restores RPG channel 2 adaptation data from an archive on the floppy on the
    local host. This command can be invoked on any of the RPG nodes, e.g. mscf,
    bdds, rpg1 and rpg2.

    restore_adapt -D /floppy/floppy0 -d 03/03/2005 -t "23:00:00"

    Searches adaptation data archive of local time "23:00:00" of date 
    "03/03/2005" in directory "/floppy/floppy0" and restores it. The archive 
    closest to the specified time is restored. This restores RPG channel 2 if
    invoked on rpg2 node. Otherwise it restores RPG channel 1.
