NAME:
       prcprtac

DESCRIPTION :
        Precipitation Rate/Accumulation Algorithm - This algorithm-task
	performs the NEXRAD Rate and Accumulation algorithms, sequentially.

	The Rate algorithm ingests the Hybrid Scan intermediate product
	from the Enhanced Precipitation Preprocessing task and converts 
	the Reflectivity values to instantaneous precipitation rate values
	(on the fixed, az/ran grid), using the Z-R relationship with its
	adaptable coefficients (selectable at the HCI menu).  

        The Precipitation Accumulation algorithm takes the precipitation
	rates from the current and previous scans and integrates over the
	scan-to-scan time period to compute the precipitation accumulation
	for each {az;ran} point, generating a Scan-to-Scan Accumulation.
	It also keeps a running, One Hour Total of the precipitation
	accumulation.  That hourly total ends at the present time except
	when the "top of the hour" is surpassed, at which time a "clock
	hourly" version is generated.

	The Scan-to-Scan and Hourly Accumulations are both contained in
	the task's intermediate output buffer.  The Scan-to-Scan Accumulations
	later contribute to the running Storm Total Accumulations.  The
	Clock Hourly accumulations are later used in the determination of
	accumulations over longer periods, such as for the Three Hour Precip
	(THP) and User-Selectable Precip (USP) products.

        The NEXRAD Algorithm Report (NAR) option of expressing precipitation
	rates and accumulations in linear units is employed.  Rates and
	accumulations are maintained to a precision of 0.01 mm/hr and 0.01 mm,
	respectively.
