NAME
    rmt_passwd - A tool for changing rssd password.

SYNOPSIS
    rmt_passwd [dir]

DESCRIPTION

    rmt_passwd is a tool for creating/updating the password file for rssd. Only
    the rssd version compiled with the secure option needs this file. The file
    is in "dir"/.rmt/.rmt_passwd or $HOME/.rmt/.rmt_passwd if "dir" is not
    specified. What is stored in the file is a encrypted version of the rssd
    password. It is not possible to recover the original password from the
    encrypted version. The file must be owned and can only be changed by the
    root user. The rmt_passwd executable must be owned by the root and has the
    "s" permission bit set so any the rssd user can change the password. In
    order to change the password, however, the user has to know the current
    password.
