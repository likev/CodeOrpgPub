NAME:
        cpc014/tsk012 - High Resolution Enhanced Echo Tops

DATA IN:
        297 (DQA)

DATA OUT:
        135 (HREET)

DESCRIPTION :
        The High Resolution Enhanced Echo Tops (HREET) algorithm processes the input 
	DQA intermediate buffer reflectivity factor data.  One intermediate
	buffer product is output from DQA upon completion of an elevation.
	HREET uses this to evaluate if the dBZ value of each gate is above 
	or below the echo top threshold. If, for a vertical column of data,
	a value equal to the echo top threshold is found (and any values
	in the column from higher elevation tilts are below the threshold),
	the echo top is calculated to be the altitude of the gate equal
	to the threshold. If a value is found to be above the echo top
	threshold and the value from the next tilt above is found to
	be below the threshold (and any values in the column from higher elevation
        tilts are below threshold), the echo top altitude is computed by
	linearly interpolating between the two adjacent tilts. Output echo top data are
	packed by byte with the most significant bit reserved for the "topped"
	flag. Data values are considered to be "topped" if the input data from the 
	highest available tilt is above the threshold, or if a lower tilt value is 
	above the threshold while the value from the adjacent tilt above contains 
	"bad data" (and any other values from the tilts above contain data below 
	the threshold).


	The program hreet_main controls the algorithm flow.  The computational
	EET code resides in hreet_compute_eet.  There the tilts are evaluated
	and the echo top altitude for each gate of the output tilt is computed. 
	Lastly, hreet_symb_layer is used to build the final ICD version of 
	this product (data and header).
