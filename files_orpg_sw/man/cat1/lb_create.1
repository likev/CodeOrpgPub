NAME
    lb_create - Creates an LB with specified attributes

SYNOPSIS
    lb_create [-snmrtubh] [LB_type ...] LB_name

DESCRIPTION

    lb_create creates an LB named "LB_name". If the named file or LB file
    exists, lb_create will remove the file or LB before creating "LB_name". The
    LB attributes can be specified with options: -s, -n, -m, -r, -t, -u and
    "LB_type". The following LB types can be specified: LB_FILE, LB_MEMORY,
    LB_NORMAL, LB_MUST_READ, LB_SINGLE_WRITER, LB_NOEXPIRE, LB_UNPROTECTED,
    LB_DB. See lb.3 for more details. The default types are LB_FILE and
    LB_NORMAL.

    LB creation is not atomic. The result of simultaneously creating the same
    LB from different applications is undefined.

OPTIONS
    -s	average_message_size
	Specifies the average message size. The default is 0 which indicates
	arbitrary message size.

    -n	max_n_msgs
	Specifies the maximum number of messages can be stored in the LB. The
	default is 100 for sequential LB and 10 for database LB.

    -m	access_mode
	Specifies the LB access permission. The default is 0666. See man-page
	of system function "open" for more about access permission.

    -r	remark
	Specifies the remark field in the LB. The default is an empty string.

    -t	tag_size
	Specifies the LB tag field size. The value must be in the range of 
	[0, 32]. The default is 0 (No tag field is supported).

    -u	notification_request_area_size
	Specifies the LB update notification request area size in number of
	requests. The default is 32 for sequential LB and 4 * max_n_msgs for 
	database LB.

    -b	Performs byte order swap in the control area of "LB_name". When an LB
	is copied over from a host with different byte order, we can run
	"lb_create -b LB_name" to convert the LB so it can be accessed.

    -h	Prints usage information and terminates.


EXAMPLES
    Example 1: lb_create t.lb
	Creates LB "t.lb" with default attributes in the current directory.

    Example 2: lb_create LB_DB LB_FILE t.lb
	Creates a database file LB "t.lb".

    Example 3: lb_create -s 128 -n 14 -r "this is my remark" -t 12 /tmp/t.lb.
	Creates LB "/tmp/t.lb" that is for up to 14 messages of size 128 bytes.
	The tag size is 12 bits and string "this is my remark" is assigned to 
	the remark field.

    Example 4: lb_create LB_DB LB_FILE apple:/tmp/t.lb
	Creates the same LB as in Example 2 on host "apple" in /tmp directory.
	In order for this to work, rssd must be running on host "apple".
   
EXIT STATUS
    0:		Terminated normally. 

    non-zero:	Terminated because an error was detected.
