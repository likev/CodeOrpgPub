NAME
    save_volume_file
    
SYNOPSIS
    save_volume_file [-dirh]
    
DESCRIPTION

    "save_volume_file" reads NEXRAD level II data from an LB and saves the data
    by creating volume files. The volume files can be read by play_a2 for
    future playback. Use control-c to stop "save_volume_file".
    "save_volume_file" creates a file for each radar scan volume. It starts a
    new file when it encounters an end-of-volume or start-of-volume radial
    which does not follow an end-of-volume radial. "save_volume_file" starts to
    save radial data immediately after it is started. Thus, if the radial data
    stream is already started, the first volume file may not contain the
    complete volume data.

    The WSR88D radar data does not contain the radar name. The user needs to
    supply the name through the "-r" option if radar name specific volume files
    are to be generated.


OPTIONS
    "save_volume_file" recognizes the following options:

	-d dir			Specifies a directory for the volume files to 
				be created. The default is the current 
				directory.
    
    	-i LB_name		Specifies the name of the input LB. The default
				is $ORPGDIR/ingest/resp.0 (The RPG radial 
				input LB).

        -r radar_name		Specifies the radar name (e.g. KTLX). The 
				default is UNKNOWN. 

    	-h			Shows the usage information.
    
EXAMPLES

    save_volume_file

	- Saves radial data in the current directory. The radar name is not 
	  known or irrelevant. The radial data are read from the RPG radial 
	  data.

    save_volume_file -d /export/home/rpg/saved_data -r KTLX -i my_radial_data

	- Saves radial data in "/export/home/rpg/saved_data". The radar name is
	  "KTLX". The radial data are read from LB file "my_radial_data".
