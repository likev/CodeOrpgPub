NAME
        prfbmap

DESCRIPTION
        The prfbmap checks the "overlaid" flag for each allowable prf and
        each range bin along the current radial.  If "overlaid" flag is set,
        the appropriate bit is set in the obscuration bit map output buffer.

        The prfbmap header file defines the constants and structs used for the
        PRF obscuration data product (PRFOVLY).  This product is used to
        identify, for different PRFs, areas of range folding (obscuration).  The
        obscuration data are contained in bitmaps.  The number of bitmaps
        correspond to the number of PRFs defined for a given product.
