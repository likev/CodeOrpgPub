NAME

   mnttsk_pgt - Initialization Task For Product Generation Table(s)

SYNOPSIS
   mnttsk_pgt [-t mode] [-C] [-A] [-B] [-M] [-a] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   This process performs product generation table (PGT) initialization 
   depending on the startup mode and command line options.  

   If the startup mode is "startup" or "restart", this process performs 
   the following actions:

      1)  In turn, the LB messages PD_CURRENT_PROD_MSG_ID ID,
          PD_DEFAULT_A_PROD_MSG_ID, PD_DEFAULT_B_PROD_MSG_ID and 
          PD_DEFAULT_M_PROD_MSG_ID are read from LB ID ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO. 
          If any message does not exist, the message is initialized.  If
          initialization fails, this process exits with a non-zero exit 
          code.
       
      2)  Initialization requires parsing the Default_prod_gen section of
          ASCII configuration file "product_tables" which are the default
          product generation table definitions.  Initialization of the 
          product generation tables requires that the product attribute table
          already exist.   The product attribute table resides as message ID
          PD_PROD_ATTR_MSG_ID in LB ID ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO.  Initialization of
          product attribute message is performed by maintenance task
          mnttsk_prod_dist.  The initialized product generation table (other
          than "current" ) is written to the appropriate message ID in LB ID 
          ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO.

          After a product generation table other than the "current" table has 
          been initialized and written to ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO, the table is copied
          to LB ID ORPGDAT_BASELINE_PROD_INFO.

          If the product generation table initialized is the "current" table, 
          then the default weather mode for startup is read from site adaptation
          data and the appropriate "default" table is copied to the "current" table
          message ID PD_CURRENT_PROD_MSG_ID in LB ID ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO.

   If the startup mode is "clear", then the initialization is performed as 
   described above for the specified table.


   Options
	-t mode		startup mode.  Determines which initialization actions to
                        be performed.  Supported startup modes are "startup", 
                        "restart", and "clear".  By default, the mode is "restart".  

        -C              Current product generation table.

        -A              Default weather mode A product generation table.

        -B              Default weather mode B product generation table.

        -M              Default maintenance mode product generation table.

	-h		Provides command line help.
