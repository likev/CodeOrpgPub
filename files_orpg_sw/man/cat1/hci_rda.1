NAME

hci_rda

SYNOPSIS

hci_rda [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_rda" command invokes the RDA alarms task for the RPG.  It is a GUI
based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is part of the
Human-Computer Interface family (HCI) of tasks.

OPTIONS

hci_rda recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-iconic       Launch the task in an iconic state
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      RPG data stores.

	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate
	
OVERVIEW

The RDA Alarms task provides a graphical user interface to view RDA alarm data.
When activated, the RDA Alarms window is displayed.  The RDA Alarms window
contains a number of filter control items and a scrolled window for displaying
color-coded RDA alarm messages. The exact appearance of the RDA Alarms window
depends on the RDA configuration. If the RDA is legacy, then hci_rda calls
hci_rda_legacy, and if RDA is ORDA, then hci_rda calls hci_rda_orda.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.

The edit box to the right of the "Maximum Displayable Alarms" label is used to
control the number of alarm messages contained in the scrolled window.  The
larger the number, the longer it takes to update the alarm message list.
Unless a long history is needed, it is suggested to keep this number less than
250.

Filtering Options
-----------------

The items in the "Device" and "Filter Parameters" containers control which
alarm messages are displayed.  All RDA alarm codes are matched to an RDA
device.  The check boxes in the "Device" container control which alarm messages
are displayed by device.  The following device filters are defined for legacy:

	ARC - Archive II
	CTR - RDA Control
	PED - Antenna/Pedestal
	USR - User
	UTL - Tower/Utilities
	WID - Wideband
	XMT - Transmitter

The following device filters are defined for ORDA:
	
	RCV - Receiver
	CTR - RDA Control
	PED - Antenna/Pedestal
	SIG - Signal Processor
	UTL - Tower/Utilities
	COM - Communications 
	XMT - Transmitter

The pushbutton in the "Device" container toggles between "None" and "All".  If
it selected when the label is "None", all of the device check boxes are cleared
and no alarm messages are displayed.  The label then changes to "All".  If it
is selected when the label is "All", all of the device check boxes are set and
all alarm messages are displayed.  The label then changes to "None".

The items in the "Filter Parameters" container control which alarm messages
are displayed based on date/time and message content.  The date and time edit
fields determine the date/time of the newest message which is displayed.  If
all fields are cleared or 0, then no date/time filtering is done.  The edit box
next to the "Search" label allows the user to input a search string.  Search
string input should be terminated by pressing the <Enter> key.  Only RDA alarm 
messages containing the search string are displayed.  Note that case is not
important.  To quickly clear the date/time and search edit boxes select the
"Clear" button.

All RDA alarm messages are color coded based on severity.  The following
color codes are defined:

	SEC  (tan)    - Secondary Alarms
	MR   (yellow) - Maintenance Required Alarms
	MM   (orange) - Maintenance Mandatory Alarms
	INOP (red)    - Inoperable Alarms

These color codes are displayed above the alarm message list for reference.

RDA Alarm List
--------------

The bottom two thirds of the window is used to display the RDA alarms list.
RDA alarm data are extracted from RDA status messages by the RDA control task
and written to a separate file from the RDA status message.  RDA alarm data
consists of an alarm code (refer to the RDA/RPG ICD for more information on the
codes and their meanings), and a date/time stamp.  The date/time corresponds
to the specific time at the RDA when the alarm occurred.  Unless the RDA and
RPG clocks are synchronized, the alarm times will not match the RPG time.

The alarms in the list are ordered from newest to oldest.  An alarm list entry
consists of the RDA time, the device which is responsible for the alarm, the
type of alarm, the RDA alarm code, and a descriptive message.  Each alarm entry
is color-coded according to its severity.

NOTES

When RDA status messages are received by the RPG, alarm codes found in the
message are written to a special RDA alarms linear buffer (ORPGDAT_RDA_ALARMS).
The header file "rda_alarm_table.h" defines the data structure used to store
RDA alarm code information.

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
