NAME

orpg.bash_profile - RPG .bash_profile template

SYNOPSIS
   orpg.bash_profile

DESCRIPTION
   This is an example of a .bash_profile file for a user of the RPG
   system using the Bash shell. It contains various RPG-specific
   variables to tailor the system to the specific user environment.
   This file should be edited for the user-specific locations of
   various files and sockets.

   When Bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, it first
   reads and executes commands from /etc/profile, if that file
   exists. Next, Bash looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login,
   and ~/.profile in that order, and reads and executes
   commands from the first one that exists and is readable.
