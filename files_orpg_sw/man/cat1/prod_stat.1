NAME
    prod_stat - A tool for displaying the PROD_STATUS_MSG message 
    in the RPG ORPGDAT_PROD_STATUS (the product generation status) 
    data store.

SYNOPSIS
    prod_stat (options) 

DESCRIPTION

    prod_stat is a tool designed for examining the RPG product generation 
    status stored in the PROD_STATUS_MSG message in the RPG ORPGDAT_PROD_STATUS 
    data store.  If event processing is specified with the "-e" option, prod_stat
    prints the product generation status every time the event is posted or
    at a frequency specified using the "-r" option.  Otherwise, prod_stat reads 
    the current message, displays the info on the screen and terminates.  The 
    "-a" command line option displays all products.  Otherwise only products 
    with product code are listed.

    prod_stat prints the product generation status in a line based format. The 
    first line tells how many products are listed in the message and how many 
    volumes are reported in the table. The second line prints the volume scan 
    sequence numbers for the volumes with the most recent volume scan listed 
    first.  The third line prints the volume scan start times obtained from the 
    radar data.  The fourth line prints the volume scan start date for each
    volume scan.  The fifth line prints the VCP number and weather mode 
    corresponding to each of the volumes. The product list then follows with 
    each line for a product. The following fields are printed for each product: 

    -	Product  ID (the RPG buffer number);
    -	Product Code ( 0 if an intermediate product);
    -	Product Mnemonic (intermediate products have no mnemonic);
    -	The 6 product dependent parameters (Refer to prod_user_msg.h);
    -	Generation period (frequency, Refer to prod_user_msg.h);
    -	Scheduling flags (Refer to prod_status.h);
    -	A list of the generated products, given by their message IDs, corresponding 
    	to the reported volumes (Refer to prod_status.h).   Products yet to be 
    	generated or failed generation for some reason give a reason in place of the 
    	message ID why the product is not available. 

OPTIONS

    -e	Prod_stat outputs based on event ORPGDAT_PROD_GEN_CONTROL. Every time 
        the event is posted, prod_stat prints the product generation info. The
        frequency of output can be controlled using the "-r" option. 
        Without this option, prod_stat prints the current product generation 
        info and terminates.

    -a  List all product status.

    -r  <rate>.  Intended to be used with -e.  This specifies the rate.  If 
        1 specified, every volume is listed.  If 2, every other volume is listed,
        etc.

EXAMPLES

    prod_stat 

    prints the current product generation status of products with product codes
    and terminates.
