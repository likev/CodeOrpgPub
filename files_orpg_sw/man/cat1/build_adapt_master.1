NAME
    build_adapt_master - Build RPG adaptation data for multiple sites.

SYNOPSIS
   build_adapt_master [options] -i input_directory -o output_directory -b blockage_directory

DESCRIPTION
    Build RPG Adaptation Data for multiple sites. Sites are processed in
    alphabetical order. The starting and ending site names can be used to build
    the adaptation data for part of the sites contained in the input directory.
    Processing will stop if an error occurs. RPG initialization problems can be
    diagnosed using the lem tool against various RPG initialization tasks.

    The input directory should contain one sub-directory per site. Each site
    sub-directory should contain one sub-directory for each RPG channel (e.g.
    rpg1, rpg2) in that site. Each channel sub-directory should contain any
    site specific RPG adaptation configuration files (e.g. site_info.dea).

    The input directory should also contain a sub-directory named "shared"
    which stores the site independent RPG adaptation configuration files that
    are not in the RPG distribution (e.g. product_user_table).

    The terrain resolution data (site.trd) for each site will be copied from
    directory "trd_dir" to the RPG CFG dir. It is used by mnttsk_hydromet uses
    to build the blockage and terrain linear buffers.

    If all files are not present, an error will be reported.

    build_adapt_master, then, invokes "mrpg init" to generate the RPG 
    adaptation data and "save_adapt" to generate the adaptation archive.

    After running this program, the output directory will contain one
    sub-directory per site. A new adaptation archive for each channel at the
    site will be created in each site sub-directory. The adaptation archive
    will contain RPG adaptation files. It will also contain the blockage.lb for
    that site. The blockage directory is where all the blockage linear buffers
    will be copied. The terrain directory is where all the terrain linear
    buffers will be copied.
	

Options
      -b blockage_dir     Directory for putting site_blockage.lb.
      -q trd_dir          Directory for getting site.trd files.
      -c    		  Clear the master output directory
      -e end_site_name    Ending site name. Site names are processed in 
			  alphabetical order. All sites on or before
			  end_site_name will be processed if this option is
			  specified.
      -h 		  print usage message and exit
      -i input_dir	  input directory
      -I 		  interactive mode. Require user input after every 
			  site.
      -o output_dir	  output directory
      -s start_site_name  Starting site name. Site names are processed in 
			  alphabetical order. All sites on or after
			  start_site_name will be processed if this option is
			  specified.
      -t terrain_dir	  Directory for putting site_terrain.lb.
      -v 		  verbose mode

EXAMPLES
    Use build_adapt_master to build adaptation archives for all sites defined
    in the /data/sites directory. Place the resulting adaptation archives in
    the $HOME/adapt_master directory.

    build_adapt_master -i /data/sites -o $HOME/adapt_master

    Use build_adapt_master to build adaptation archive(s) for a single site.
    The -I option forces the user to process or skip each site. The -s option
    starts processing a specific site. Sites are processed in alphabetical
    order. The -e option could also be used to specify the ending site (In this
    case, the -I option would not be needed because the starting and ending
    site could be the same ie. build_adapt_master ... -s DOP1 -e DOP1).

    build_adapt_master -i /data/sites -o $HOME/adapt_master -I -s DOP1
