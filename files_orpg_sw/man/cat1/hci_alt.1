SYNOPSIS

hci_alt [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_alt" command invokes the Alert Threshold Table Edit task for the RPG.
It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is
part of the Human-Computer Interface family (HCI) of tasks, typically launched
from the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can
be run as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_alt recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-iconic       Launch the task in an iconic state
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      RPG data stores.

	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate
	
OVERVIEW

The Alert Threshold Edit task provides a graphical user interface to view and
edit RPG alert threshold adaptation data.  When activated, the Alert Threshold
Editor window is displayed.  It consists of a set of control buttons and a
table.  Alert threshold adaptation data are maintained in two messages: a
baseline (backup) copy and an copy.  All edits are made to the edit (working)
copy and other RPG tasks use data from the edit copy.

Control Buttons
---------------

The control buttons are located at the top of the window.

The "Close" button is located in the upper left corner of the window.
Selecting it exits the hci_alt task.  If any edits have been made  and not
saved, when the "Close" button is selected, the user will be prompted as to
whether to save the changes or not.

Since alert threshold adaptation data are required to be password protected, a
lock icon is displayed in the upper right corner of the window.  Selecting it
allows the user to select a password level and enter a password.  When the
user selects a password level in the password popup window, items in the Alert
Threshold Editor window which are editable by that password level are displayed
in a gray foreground color.  The fuzzy appearance of objects in the Alert
Threshold Editor window indicate that they are not editable until a valid
password has been entered.  Once a valid password is entered in the password
window, the password window is closed and all editable/selectable objects in
the Alert Threshold Editor window become sharp in appearance.

If the window is unlocked for editing, the "Save" and "Undo" buttons remain
desensitized until edits are made.  The "Restore" and "Update" buttons are
sensitized as long as the window is unlocked for editing.

Selecting the "Save" button writes any table changes to the alert threshold
adaptation data edit message.  A confirmation popup window is displayed
allowing the user to accept or cancel the save operation.  If the user cancels
a save operation, local edits are unaffected.

Selecting the "Undo" button results in all unsaved edits being discarded and
the window restored to its pre-edit state.

Selecting the "Restore" button results in baseline data replacing the edit
copy of the data.  A confirmation popup window is first displayed for
verification.  The display is updated with the new values.
.
Selecting the "Update" button results in data from the edit message replacing
data in the baseline message.  A confirmation popup window is first displayed
for verification.

The "Group" radio buttons determine which alert threshold table group is
displayed in the table.  The following alert threshold groups are defined:
"Grid", "Volume", and "Forecast".  By default, the Grid group is displayed
initially.  NOTE: The group information is defined by a configuration file
which is read at task startup.  Refer to the man page alert_table(4) for
information on this configuration file.

Alert Threshold Table
---------------------

The alert threshold table consists of a row of text widgets and an option menu
for each category in the specified group.  A row consists of a category name,
units, minimum and maximum allowed value, up to 6 threshold values, and a
paired product name.  The elements which are editable are the threshold values
and paired product name.  Threshold elements and paired product name are
desensitized until a valid URC or ROC level password is entered.  Threshold
values within a category must be in ascending order and fall within the range
defined by the minimum and maximum.  If a value outside the specified range is
entered, the value for the item is not changed and a popup window is displayed
indicating the value is out of range.  The paired product name is part of a
popup menu containing a list of all products which can be paired with the
category.  Selecting a product from the popup menu will result in that product
name being paired with the category.

NOTES

For this function to be successful, the Alert Threshold data store 
(ORPGDAT_ALERT_THRESHOLD) should be properly initialized.  It should contain
4 messages; edit and baseline copies for category and group definitions.
It is normally initialized during the initial RPG startup.  Refer to the
header file alert_threshold.h for message format and ID information.

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
