NAME:
        cpc004/tsk012 - Dual Pol Elevation Product Algorithm

DESCRIPTION:
        Dual Pol Elevation Product Algorithm - dp_elev_prod inputs 360
        radials of Dual Pol moments and hydroclasses from the DP_BASE_HC_AND_ML
        buffer, and packages it as a complete elevation, DP_MOMENTS_ELEV.

        The 11 moments collected are:

           KDP - Specific differential phase
           ML  - Melting layer
           PHI - Differential phase          (unused by qperate)
           RHO - Correlation coefficient
           SDP - Differential phase texture  (unused by qperate)
           SDZ - Reflectivity texture        (unused by qperate)
           SMV - Smoothed velocity           (unused by qperate)
           SMZ - Smoothed reflectivity
           SNR - Signal to noise ratio       (unused by qperate)
           ZDR - Differential reflectivity
           HCA - Hydroclass

        The hydroclass, HCA, is radially mode filtered. The range of bins to
        filter on is an adaptable parameter with a default of 9. After filtering,
        the HCA moment is renamed Elevation Hydro Class (EHC).
