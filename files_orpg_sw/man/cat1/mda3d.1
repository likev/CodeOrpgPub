NAME:
	mda3d: Mesocyclone Detection Algorithm (3 dimension)  

DESCRIPTION :
	2D features from adjacent elevation scans are vertically
        correlated into potential three-dimensional (3D) features.
        The mesocyclone 3D features are associated with Storm
        cells and their attributes are computed and saved.
	Process starts with any 2D feature on the first tilt.

	To implement the rapid update functionality, each 3D couplet will be
        checked to see if they are topped and if they are downgraded at each
        elevation.
