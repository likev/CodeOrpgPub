NAME
   mnttsk_hydromet - Initialization Task For Hydromet Files

SYNOPSIS
   mnttsk_hydromet [-t action] [-p] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   This process performs hydromet file initialization.

   The startup action (see Options) can take on one of the following values:  
   "startup", "restart", "check", "clear_hydro", "clear_gage", and 
   "clear_blockage".  For each action, the following steps are performed: 

   startup:

      1)  Initialize LB ID GAGEDATA data if the gagedata does not exist. 
          The initial gagedata message consists of all 0's.

      2)  Initialize LB ID HYUSRSEL data if the hydromet user selectable 
          precipitation product data does not exist. The initialization is
          the same initialization as can be found in file A31472__INIT_USDB.
          
      3)  Initialize LB ID BLOCKAGE data if the Beam Blockage linear buffer
          does not contain any data.  If beam blockage data resides in the 
          ORPGCFG_DIR/bin directory, this file is copied to the location 
          specified by the data tables.  If this file does not exits, 
          then site specific terrain data file read, the beam blockage computed, 
          and the data is stored in the directory specified by the data tables.

   restart:

      There are no actions currently defined for "restart".

   check:

      1)  Checks the Accumulation file (HYACCUMS.DAT) for data.  If the file
          exists but is empty, the file is removed.  

      2)  Checks the Gage Scan file (HYGAGSCN.DAT) for data.  If the file 
          exists but is empty, the file is removed.
       
      3)  Checks the Hydromet Product file (HYPROD.DAT) for data.  If the file 
          exists but is empty, the file is removed.

      4)  Checks the Gage-Radar Pair file (HYGRPAIR.DAT) for data.  If the file 
          exists but is empty, the file is removed.

   clear_hydro:

      The following files are removed:  Accumulation file (HYACCUMS.DAT), 
      Gage Scan file (HYGAGSCN.DAT), and Hydromet Products file (HYPROD.DAT).


   clear_gage:

      All messages removed from LB ID GAGEDATA.

   clear_blockage:
   
      All the messages are removed from the LB ID BLOCKAGE.

   Options
	-t mode		startup mode.  Determines which initialization actions to
                        be performed.  Supported startup modes are "startup" and
                        "restart".  By default, the mode is "restart".
