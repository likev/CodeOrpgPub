NAME

hci_rda_link

SYNOPSIS

hci_rda_link [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_rda_link" command invokes the RDA/RPG Interface Control/Status task
for the RPG.  It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif
environment, functionally identical to the RDA/RPG Interface Control/Status
function in the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  It can be
run as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_rda_link recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The RDA/RPG Interface Control/Status task provides a graphical user interface
to monitor and control the wideband interface between the RDA and RPG.  Several
adaptable interface parameters can be edited.  When activated, the RDA/RPG
Interface Control/Status window is displayed.  This window contains several
control buttons, status labels and edit boxes.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.  If any unsaved edits are
detected, a warning popup window is first displayed so the user can have one
last chance to save them.

The "Save" button is selectable whenever any edits are made.  When selected,
a confirmation popup window is first displayed.  If an affirmative response is
made edits are save to file and are available to all other RPG tasks at that
time.

The "Undo" button is selectable whenever any edits are made.  The selected,
all edits are discarded and adaptation data is reloaded from file and displayed.

The "State" label displays the color-coded state of the RDA/RPG link.  The
following states are defined:

	Not Implemented         (white)
	Connect Pending         (yellow)
	Disconnect Pending      (yellow)
	Disconnected (HCI)      (yellow)
	Disconnected (CM)       (yellow)
	Disconnected (SHUTDOWN) (yellow)
	Connected               (green)
	Down                    (red)
	Failure                 (red)
	Unknown                 (red)

The "Wideband Control" radio buttons are used to send wideband control commands
to the RDA control task.  If the RDA/RPG link is currently connected, the
"Connect" radio button is desensitized, otherwise it is sensitized.  The
"Disconnect" button is always sensitized.  Selecting one of these radio buttons
first activates a warning popup window from which the user can accept or cancel
the operation.

The Wideband Interface Parameters edit boxes allow the user to define the
number of retries, timeouts, and control the loopback rate.  A check box is
displayed to the right of the loopback rate edit box so the user can enable
or disable RPG to RDA loopback checking.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
