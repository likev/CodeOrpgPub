NAME
rms_read_msg - A test tool that reads the messages generated ny the ORPG/RMS
and prints them out in a format readable by the user.

SYNOPSIS

        rms_read_message

DESCRIPTION :

      The rms read message tool allows the operator to read the messages
      generated by the ORPG/RMS. The tool is run in a separate terminal
      window. When the ORPG/RMS interface places a message in the output
      buffer it posts an event to alert the port manager that a message needs
      sending. The read message program will receive this same event and read
      the message from the output linear buffer.  It will then decode the
      message and print it in a format that can be easily read by the user.
      The tool can be run while the interface is connected and in no way
      affects the communication between the ORPG/RMS and the FAA/RMMS.

      The read message tool can also be used to generate acknowledgement
      messages, if a connection between the ORPG/RMS and an FAA/RMMS is not
      available. The read message tool will keep the ORPG/RMS interface up by
      simulating a connection. The option to simulate this connection is offered
      when the tool is first started. The user will be prompted whether or not
      acknowledgement messages are wanted.

Options: None
