NAME

xpdt - the ORPG product display tool

SYNOPSIS

xpdt [filename]

DESCRIPTION

"xpdt" is the X windows Product Display Tool (XPDT) for the Open Systems Radar
Product Generator (ORPG).  Its purpose is to display an RPG product in an X
Window.  Both legacy RPG and ORPG generated files can be displayed.  This tool
is not intended to be an operational tool.  Its primary purpose is to allow
maintainers and developers to view RPG generated products.

The user has the option of directly displaying an RPG product file created on
the legacy RPG or by displaying products contained in the RPG products data
base.  When a new product is selected from the RPG products database, the
latest product is loaded and displayed.  To update the products menu, the user
should reselect the "Product" button.  The left and right arrow buttons in the
lower right corner of the window control which product time is displayed.  When
an arrow is displayed with a white background, it means that there are no more
products available to display in that time direction.

An ORPG product can consist of one or more separate windows.  All graphics are
displayed in the main window.  If product tabular data exist, they are
displayed in a separate text window.  Buttons are provided to select from
multiple pages of information.

Some products (i.e., hail and storm track) provide popup windows to control the
how the product information is displayed.  For instance, a popup window is
provided to allow the user to change hail threshold values for hail products.

The main display window consists of four parts: graphics attributes table, data
display region, color bar, and control buttons.

The graphics attributes table is displayed in the upper portion of the main
display window for those products containing graphics attributes information.
To view different pages of information move the cursor over the table and press
the left mouse button.

The data display region is where all graphical information is displayed.

The color bar is displayed in the right side of the main display window.  All
colors used to display information in the data display region are represented
along with labels assigning a value or range of values for each color.

The control buttons are displayed at the bottom of the main display window.

Selecting the "File" button activates the Product File Control window.  This
window contains three buttons: "Close", "Open" and "Save".  Selecting the
"Close" buttons closes the Product file Control window.  Selecting the "Open"
button activates a file select dialog window from which the user can select a
regular product file to open.  Selecting the "Save" button activates a file
select dialog window from which the user can define a filename to write the
currently active product data to.

Selecting the "Product" button activates the Products in Database window.  This
window contains selections to retrieve products from the RPG products database.
The user should select a product type and time.  For elevation based products,
all cuts for the selected time are displayed.  To display a different cut
simply select it from the list.  After a product has been displayed, selecting
the "Product" button again updates the Products in Database window data and
the currently displayed product.

Selecting the "Grid" button toggles on/off the display of a polar grid in the
data display region.

Selecting the "Map" button toggles on/off the display of a background map in
the data display region.  To display a map the environment variable 
"XPDT_MAP_FILE" must be defined.  This environmental variable defines the
path and name of the map file.

The arrow buttons are used to switch products in a multi-product file (ORPG
products only) to the previous volume time (left arrow) or the next volume
time (right arrow).

NOTE

Not all RPG product types are supported.  Multilayered products are not
supported (i.e., RCM, DPA).
