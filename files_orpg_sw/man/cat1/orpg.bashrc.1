NAME

orpg.bashrc - RPG .bashrc template

SYNOPSIS
   orpg.bashrc

DESCRIPTION
   This is an example of a .bashrc file for a user of the RPG
   system using the Bash shell. When an interactive Bash shell
   that is not a login shell is started, Bash reads and executes
   commands from the user's .bashrc file, if that file exists.
   Instead of keeping two separate files with duplicate 
   environmental settings (1 for interactive login shell, 1 for
   interactive non-login shell), it is easier to keep the
   environmental settings in the interactive login script (.profile)
   and have .bashrc source that file during an interactive non-login
   session.

   This file should be named ".bashrc" in the user's home directory.
