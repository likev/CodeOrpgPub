DESCRIPTION :
        The Radar Echo Classifier (REC) algorithm processes raw base data
        to determine the likelihood of a specific category of target.  In
        this implementation the target is anomalous propagation(AP)/ground
        clutter.  Refer to document NX-DR-03-071/01 for the REC algorithm
        enunciation language (AEL).  In summary, the algorithm computes
        several pattern characteristic values for each reflectivity bin
        (out to 230 km only) and each Doppler bin.  It then normalizes the
        pattern characteristic values (i.e. scales them from 0 to 1) and,
        based on weighting factors, combines them into a probability, or
        percentage likelihood, that the radar is detecting the target
        category.  The scaling and weighting factors are part of orpg
        adaptation data.
                
        Two intermediate products are output and used by the REC's product
        producing task (recclprods) to create radial format displays of
        Clutter Likelihood Reflectivity (CLR) and Clutter Likelihood
        Doppler (CLD) products.  The reflectivity version contains target
        likelihood percentages for reflectivity radials while the Doppler
        version contains target likelihood percentages for Doppler radials.
        
        This task is elevation based and, if requested, outputs two
        intermediate products at the end of each elevation.
        
        Besides the main() function, there are four key functions in
        this algorithm.  These key functions populate global working arrays
        with pattern characteristic values for each reflectivity and
        Doppler bin.  The first key function, named classify_echo(), is
        called from main() at the end of an elevation.  Classify_echo()
        calls, in order, compute_Z_texture(), compute_V_stddev() and finally
        compute_probs().  Upon returning to main(), the reflectivity and
        Doppler target likelihood arrays are copied to the intermediate
        product output buffers and forwarded back to the orpg infrastructure.
        
        The second key function, compute_Z_texture(), is responsible for
        filling arrays with the reflectivity pattern characteristics.
        Currently, these are:  texture, mean sign of reflectivity change,
        and reflectivity spin.  See the AEL document for detailed
        definitions of these pattern characteristics.
        
        The third key function, compute_V_stddev(), is responsible for
        filling arrays with the Doppler pattern characteristics.  Currently,
        these are:  mean velocity, standard deviation of mean velocity, and
        mean spectrum width.  See the AEL document for detailed definitions
        of these pattern characteristics.
        
        The fourth key function, compute_probs(), is responsible for scaling
        the pattern characteristics values of each bin to values ranging
        from 0 to 1.  The scaling is performed by using adaptation data
        values that define the low limit (0) and high limit (1) values for
        each pattern characteristic.  The function then uses weighting
        factors from adaptation data to combine the scaled pattern
        characteristics into a percentage likelihood that the radar is
        detecting the target category (AP/clutter).  A weighting factor
        enables a pattern characteristic to have more (or less) weight in the
        final likelihood value than another pattern characteristic.
        
        Although there are separate products for reflectivity radials and
        Doppler radials, it should be noted that all pattern characteristics
        (both reflectivity and Doppler) are used in the determination of
        target likelihood percentages in each product, assuming the pattern
        characteristic's weighting factor is greater than zero.
