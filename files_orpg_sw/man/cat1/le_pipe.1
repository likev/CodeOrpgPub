NAME
     le_pipe - Pipe stdout or stderr into an LE log file

SYNOPSIS
     le_pipe [options]

DESCRIPTION
	Read data from stdin or from a file and write the
     data, one line at a time into an LE log file.  This program
     is useful for writing to ORPG log files from a script or
     for re-directing the output of 3rd party tools into ORPG
     log files.  It is generally used with the | operator on
     the command line or in a script.
	Each line of the input file is read from the beginning
     of the file.  Newline characters are assumed to be a line
     separator in the input file.  Each line generates a separate
     LE message.  If an input line is longer than the maximum LE
     message length, it will be split into multiple LE messages.
     The output LE log file will be created in the directory
     specified by the LE_DIR_EVENT environment variable if it
     does not exist.  LB creation parameters can be specified
     on the command line to control some information about the
     created LE log file.  Since le_pipe is sometime run from the
     super-user account, command line options are provided for
     setting the user id and group id of the created LE log file.
     Other options are provided to set the LE error code, specify
     which log file where the messages will be written, and force
     re-creation of the output log file even if it already exists.
	Currently, this tool does not cause any messages to be
     written to the ORPG system log file.  It may do this in
     the future.

OPTIONS
	-h                  print usage information
        -a avg_msg_size     average msg size for a newly created output
			    log file (default: unspecified)
	-c                  create a new log file even if it already exists
			    (default: do not force creation)
        -e error_type       GL_ERROR or GL_STATUS (default: GL_INFO)
        -f file_name        input file name (default: stdin)
        -g group_id         group id to use if log file is created
        -i instance no      instance number (default: unspecified)
        -m mode             permissions if log file is created(in octal)
        -n no_of_msgs       max no of msgs for a newly created output
			    log file (default: 25)
        -o error_no         error number for GL_ERROR log messages
        -s sleep_time       number of milli-seconds to sleep between reads
			    of the input file (default: 500)
        -t task_name        task name to log message for (default: le_pipe)
        -v                  turn verbosity on
        -w owner            owner id to use if log file is created

EXAMPLES
     Cause a message to be sent to the mrpg log file from the task_table
     configuration file.

     	Add the following to the Startup_init_cmds section of the task_table
	configuration file.

	echo "This is my message" | le_pipe -e GL_INFO -t mrpg

	When mrpg startup is executed, the above command will be executed, and
	"This is my message" will be put in the mrpg log file.

     Put the results of the 3rd party tool, snmptrapd, into an LE log file.
     Since snmptrapd is executed as super-user, and the application that reads
     the information is in the rpg account, the output log file must be created
     with the user id and group id of the rpg account.  The output LE log file
     will contain 5000 messages with an average size of 100 bytes per message.

        From bourne shell:

        snmptrapd -m ALL -s -P | le_pipe -t trap -g 100 -w 200 -n 5000 -a 100 2>&1 &

     All of the information written to stdout and stderr by snmptrapd will be
     written to the trap.log file that will be created in the directory specified
     in the LE_DIR_EVENT environment variable.
