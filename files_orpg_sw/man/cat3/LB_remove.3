NAME
LB_remove - remove a Linear Buffer (LB) file

SYNOPSIS
#include <lb.h>
int LB_remove (char *lb_name)

DESCRIPTION
This function removes the LB named "lb_name". It frees the shared 
memory resource allocated for the LB and "unlink"s the LB file. A 
removed LB can not be opened as an existing LB. Currently open LB 
descriptors, however, are not affected until they are closed. 

LB_remove does not remove "lb_name" if it is not a valid LB file. 
Thus if an LB file is corrupted, it can not be removed by LB_remove.

This function returns LB_SUCCESS on success or one of the following 
negative numbers:

	LB_BAD_ARGUMENT:	One of the arguments does not make 
				sense.
	LB_REMOVE_FAILED:	LB_remove failed due to a permission 
				problem or other system errors.
	LB_NON_LB_FILE:		"lb_name" is not a valid LB file.
