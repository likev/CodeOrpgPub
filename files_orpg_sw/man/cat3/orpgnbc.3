DESCRIPTION
    NBC is the Narrow Band Control module of liborpg.

    ORPGNBC_send_NB_link_control_command sends a narrow band link control
    command "cmd" to p_server. It sends the command to all p_server instances.
    Argument "cmd" may be one of the following (defined in prod_distri_info.h):

	CMD_SHUTDOWN:		Shuts down all NB service.
	CMD_SWITCH_TO_INACTIVE:	Switch p_server to inactive mode.
	CMD_SWITCH_TO_ACTIVE:	Switch p_server to active mode.
	CMD_CONNECT:		Connect line "line_ind".
	CMD_DISCONNECT:		Disconnect line "line_ind".

    Argument "line_ind" is not used for cmd = CMD_SHUTDOWN,
    CMD_SWITCH_TO_INACTIVE, and CMD_SWITCH_TO_ACTIVE. To perform the job,
    ORPGNBC_send_NB_link_control_command posts event ORPGEVT_PD_LINE.
    ORPGNBC_send_NB_link_control_command returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.

    This function can not be used for sending commands CMD_REQUEST_APUP_STATUS
    and CMD_LINK_STATE_CHANGED.

    ORPGNBC_enable_disable_NB_links sends a enable/disable link command to the
    p_server. It sends the command to all p_server instances. Argument
    "command" must be either NBC_DISABLE_LINK or NBC_ENABLE_LINK.

    One specifies the links to be enables/disabled in array "line_ind". The
    size of "line_ind" is "n_lines".

    To perform the job, ORPGNBC_enable_disable_NB_links locks the
    PD_LINE_INFO_MSG_ID message in data store ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO, updates the
    message (as described in prod_distri_info.h) and posts events
    ORPGEVT_PD_LINE.

    ORPGNBC_enable_disable_NB_links returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.

    ORPGNBC_connect_disconnect_NB_links sends a connect/disconnect link command
    to the p_server. It sends the command to all p_server instances. Argument
    "command" must be either NBC_DISCONNECT or NBC_CONNECT.

    One specifies the links to be enables/disabled in array "line_ind". The
    size of "line_ind" is "n_lines".

    To perform the job, ORPGNBC_connect_disconnect_NB_links locks the
    PD_LINE_INFO_MSG_ID message in data store ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO, updates the
    message (as described in prod_distri_info.h) and posts events
    ORPGEVT_PD_LINE.

    ORPGNBC_connect_disconnect_NB_links returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.

    ORPGNBC_request_APUP_status sends a command to the p_server requesting APUP
    status. It sends the command to all p_server instances. Argument "line_ind"
    specifies the link of the specified APUP. "line_ind" may also take one of
    the values of BC_ALL_DEDICATED, NBC_ALL_DIAL_IN and NBC_ALL_LINES.

    To perform the job, ORPGNBC_request_APUP_status locks the
    PD_LINE_INFO_MSG_ID message in data store ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO, updates the
    message (as described in prod_distri_info.h) and posts events
    ORPGEVT_PD_LINE.

    ORPGNBC_request_APUP_status returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.

    ORPGNBC_get_user_profile reads a user profile completed with class
    information. Argument "line_type" specifies the line type: DEDICATED,
    DIAL_IN or DIAL_OUT. "uid" specifying the user ID when "line_type" !=
    DEDICATED. "line_ind" specifying the line index when "line_type" is
    DEDICATED.

    A pointer to the user profile is returned, on success, through argument
    "up". The caller must free this pointer after finishing using it.

    ORPGNBC_get_user_profile returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.

    ORPGNBC_n_lines returns the number of listed NB lines in the product
    distribution line info (data store ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO, message
    PD_LINE_INFO_MSG_ID).

    ORPGNBC_n_lines returns the number of listed NB lines or -1 on failure.

    ORPGNBC_send_NB_vv_control_command sends a V&V control command "command" to
    the p_server. "command" can be either CMD_VV_ON or CMD_VV_OFF as defined in
    prod_distri_info.h. It returns 0 on success or -1 on failure.
