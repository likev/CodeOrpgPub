msleep(3) 		   ORPG SDD Manpage   		msleep(3)

NAME
msleep() - put the task in sleep (suspended) mode for specified milli-
		seconds.

SYNOPSIS
#include <misc.h>
int msleep (int ms);

DESCRIPTION
msleep puts the calling task in sleep (suspended) mode for "ms" milli-
seconds. It calls the "select" system call to perform the task. Thus 
it does not use a timer. It may return before the scheduled time due
to a signal.

RETURN VALUE
msleep returns 0, which is not useful.

NOTES
Because the select system call is not portable, a portable application
should use this function for sleep. This function is different from the
C "sleep" function, which typically uses the UNIX timer and thus can 
cause conflict if the application also uses the timer.
