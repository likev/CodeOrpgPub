NAME
MALRM_register - register a Multiple Alarm Services (MALRM) alarm

SYNOPSIS
#include <malrm.h>
int MALRM_register(malrm_id_t alarmid, void (*callback)())

DESCRIPTION
The specified MALRM alarm is registered.

"alarmid" is assumed to be a valid alarm ID (zero is not a valid alarm ID).

"callback" is a pointer to an MALRM alarm callback routine that the user
wishes to have invoked upon occurrence of the specified alarm.

This callback routine must be defined as follows (the name, of course,
will be selected by the user):

void callback(malrm_id_t alarmid)

The scope of the MALRM alarm callback routine lies within the scope
of an MALRM library signal handler, so accepted signal-handler design
principles should be used when designing the callback routine.  All
blockable POSIX signals are blocked while the MALRM library signal handler
is executing.

Any process using the "MALRM_register" library routine must not trap
or otherwise interact with the signal corresponding to MALRM_ALARM_SIG.

RETURN VALUES
The number of registered alarms, or a negative value corresponding
to one of the following macros on failure:

MALRM_BAD_ALARMID	invalid alarm ID (e.g., '0')

MALRM_DUPL_REG		attempt to re-register a registered alarm

MALRML_SUSPECT_PTR	the callback routine pointer is suspect

MALRM_TOO_MANY_ALARMS	attempt to register more than MALRM_MAX_ALARMS
				alarms

MALRM_SIGACTION_FAILED
MALRM_SIGEMPTYSET_FAILED
