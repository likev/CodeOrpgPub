NAME
MALRM_set - set a Multiple Alarm Services (MALRM) alarm

SYNOPSIS
#include <malrm.h>
int MALRM_set(malrm_id_t alarmid,time_t start_time, unsigned int interval_secs)

DESCRIPTION
The specified MALRM alarm is set.

"alarmid" is assumed to be a valid alarm ID (zero is not a valid alarm ID)
that corresponds to an alarm that is registered.  If the alarm is not
currently set, it will be set; otherwise, it will be reset.

"start_time" is the POSIX time at which the first invocation of the
registered MALRM alarm callback routine is to take place.  The macro
MALRM_START_TIME_NOW is provided when the user requires that the callback
routine be invoked immediately.

"interval_secs" is the number of seconds that should elapse between
subsequent invocations of the alarm callback routine.  The following macros
are provided:

	MALRM_ONESHOT_NTVL	"one-shot" (no intervals)
	MALRM_MIN_NTVL		a minute-long interval
	MALRM_HOUR_NTVL		an hour-long interval
	MALRM_DAY_NTVL		a day-long interval

Any process using the "MALRM_set" library routine must not trap
or otherwise interact with the signal corresponding to MALRM_ALARM_SIG.

RETURN VALUES
Zero upon success, or a negative value corresponding to one of the following
macros on failure:

MALRM_BAD_ALARMID		invalid alarm ID (e.g., '0')

MALRM_BAD_START_TIME		invalid POSIX start time (e.g., earlier than
					current POSIX time)

MALRM_ALARM_NOT_REGISTERED	attempt to set an unregistered alarm
