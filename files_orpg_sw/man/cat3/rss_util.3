NAME
rss_util - Remote System Services (RSS) utility routines

SYNOPSIS
#include <rss.h>
int RSS_test_rpc (char *host);

DESCRIPTION
RSS_test_rpc is a tool for testing if the RMT server on host "host" 
is responding. It returns RSS_SUCCESS (0) if it is responding or a 
negative error number otherwise.  If "host" is NULL or a NULL string, 
the host is assumed to be local. RSS_test_rpc is implemented by 
calling RSS_time. Thus it is not a true RPC function. It can also
be used for finding whether a local "rssd" is running.


In the current implementation, RSS locks the connection when there is 
a file or an LB opened on a remote host until the file or LB is closed.
For other RSS functions, a connection is closed after the function 
call is finished.
