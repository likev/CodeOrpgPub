NAME
LB_stat - return status information for a Linear Buffer (LB) file

SYNOPSIS
#include <lb.h>
int LB_stat (int lbd, LB_status *status)

DESCRIPTION
This function returns, in argument "status", the status information 
which includes the following fields:

	LB_attr *attr:	The LB attributes.

	time_t time:	LB creation time.

	int n_msgs:	Number of messages in the LB.

	int updated:	LB_TRUE or LB_FALSE - the update status (the LB 
			has been updated since last LB_stat call). For 
			LB_REPLACE type LB, this field is set to LB_TRUE 
			if a new message is added, a message is removed 
			or any of the listed message in check_list is 
			replaced since last LB_stat call. For other 
			types of LB, this field is set to LB_TRUE 
			if a new message is added or any message is 
			removed.

	int n_check:	The number of messages to be checked for update 
			(the size of array check_list). This and the 
			next "check_list" are used for LB_REPLACE type 
			only. For non-LB_REPLACE, if n_check is not 
			zero, LB_stat will fail.

	LB_check_list *check_list: The array used for message based 
			update check. The LB_check_list structure has 
			the following two fields:

	LB_id_t id:	 message id;

	int status:	 message status;

			For each element in array check_list, the user 
			specifies, in check_list[i].id, the id of a 
			message that requires update check. Upon return 
			check_list[i].status is assigned by 
			LB_MSG_UPDATED, LB_MSG_NOCHANGE or 
			LB_MSG_NOT_FOUND if the message is respectively 
			updated (i.e. replaced), since the previous 
			LB_stat call, not updated or not found in the 
			LB. Array check_list must have "n_check" 
			effective elements.

If "attr" is NULL, LB_attr is not returned. If n_check is 0, 
"check_list" is never used. 

LB_stat returns LB_SUCCESS on success or one of the following 
negative numbers to indicate an error:

	LB_BAD_DESCRIPTOR:	"lbd" is not a valid LB descriptor.
	LB_N_CHECK_ERROR:	n_check is non-zero and the LB is not
				of LB_REPLACE type.
	LB_MALLOC_FAILED:	Failed in allocating memory.
	LB_SHMDT_FAILED:	Failed in shmdt system call.
	LB_LOCK_FAILED:		Failed in a lock system call.
	LB_MMAP_FAILED:		Failed in mmap system call.
	LB_MPROTECT_FAILED:	Failed in mprotect system call.
