NAME
LB_clear - remove specified number of oldest unexpired messages from a
		Linear Buffer (LB) file

SYNOPSIS
#include <lb.h>
int LB_clear (int lbd, int nrms)

DESCRIPTION
This function removes "nrms" oldest unexpired messages in the LB. 
"nrms" can take a value of LB_ALL, which means that all existing 
messages will be removed. It can be called only if the LB is opened 
with LB_WRITE. If all messages are removed, new messages will be 
stored starting from the beginning of the message area. The 
messages are removed regardless of flags LB_REPLACE, LB_MUST_READ 
and LB_NOEXPIRE.

On success it returns the number of messages removed or one of the 
following negative numbers on failure.

	LB_BAD_ARGUMENT:	One of the arguments does not make 
				sense.
	LB_BAD_DESCRIPTOR:	Unopened or closed LB descriptor is 
				used.
	LB_BAD_ACCESS:		The LB is not opened as LB_WRITE.
	LB_PARITY_ERROR:	The user's LB data structure (not the 
				LB) is corrupted by 
				the caller due to a memory leak.

	LB_LOCK_FAILED:		Failed in a lock system call.
	LB_MMAP_FAILED:		Failed in mmap system call.
