NAME
CS_use_LB - attempt to read configuration text from linear buffer file

SYNOPSIS
#include <infr.h>
void CS_use_LB ();

DESCRIPTION
By default, the configuration text is read from a regular file. If function
CS_use_LB is called, CS will first try to open the configuration source as
an LB. If LB_open fails, CS will then open it as a file. The name of the
configuration source (file of LB) is by default defined by an environmental
variable CFG_SRC. An alternative source name can be assigned by calling
CS_cfg_name. If an LB is used, the configuration message ID must be 1
(CS_CFG_MSG). If function CS_use_LB is never called, the LB library is not
required.
