NAME
CS_event - specify a configuration-change event number

SYNOPSIS
#include <infr.h>
int CS_event (int syscfg_ev, int *status);

DESCRIPTION
Function CS_event specifies, through "syscfg_ev", the event number that 
the application is used for the event of a configuration change. After
the event number is specified, every such event will cause an update
(reread from the file or LB) of the configuration text. Multiple event
numbers that correspond to the configuration change can be specified
through multiple calls of CS_event.

By option CS_event allows the user to register a configuration status 
variable in the CS module. If "status" is not NULL, this integer pointer 
is recorded in the CS module. Later on, each time the configuration 
changes, "status" is set to CS_UPDATED (non-zero). This provides an 
efficient way for the calling routine to check whether or not the 
configuration is changed. Multiple "status" variables can be registered 
through multiple calls of CS_event. "status" is set only when an event is 
received. The initial configuration read or forced update through calling 
CS_control (CS_UPDATE) will not set the "status" variables.

If function CS_event is never called, the event notification library is 
not required.

On success CS_event returns 0. Otherwise it returns one of the following 
negative numbers:

	CS_TOO_MANY_STATUS - Too many status variables registered;
	CS_TOO_MANY_EVENTS - Too many event number registered;

If CS_event fails in registering an event (E.g. rssd is not 
running), CS_event will not return an error number. Because of this 
error however later calls to functions CS_int_entry and CS_name_entry 
will fail and return CS_EV_REGISTER_ERR if the configuration source name 
does not have a suffix of ".dev". If the configuration source name has a 
suffix ".dev", any failure in registering an event will be ignored. This 
allows the user to proceed without the EN service, which may be desirable 
in development time. An operational configuration source name should 
never use suffix ".dev".

The configuration LB or file must be on the local host.

NOTES
The event number definition is a part of application design. By 
requiring the application to pass the event number (through calling 
CS_event), we make the CS module independent of the application. For the 
same matter CS does not define the format of each configuration entry. 
Each entry may contain multiple fields. It is up to the application to 
define the fields in the entries and interpret the entries. Tools may
need to be developed for automatically creating the configuration text by
