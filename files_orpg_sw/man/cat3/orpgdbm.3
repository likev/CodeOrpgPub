NAME
orpgdbm - ORPG Library Products Data Base (DBM) access routines

SYNOPSIS
	cc [ flag ... ] file ... -lorpg -linfr [ library ... ]

#include <orpg.h>

int	ORPGDBM_query (RPG_prod_rec_t *db_info, ORPGDBM_query_data_t *data,
		       int data_len, int max_list_size)
int	ORPGDBM_read (int prod_code, char **buf, int vol_time, short *params)


DESCRIPTION

These functions provide access to the ORPG Products Database.

ORPGDBM_read() queries the ORPG Products Database to find a match to
the user specified product code (code in range 16-90), volume time,
and parameter list.  The volume time is in UNIX seconds (from 1/1/1970).
If a -1 is specified for the volume time, the latest time in the
matched list is used.  The parameter list is one or more of the
parameters (up to 6) defined for the product associated with the
product ID.  See the product attributes table (PAT) for information
on the parameters used for each product.

If the user does not care about matching a particular parameter,
then the macro PARAM_ANY_VALUE should be specified for that parameter.
Only those parameters defined in the product attributes table for the
product are compared.

If a match is found, ORPGDBM_read() returns a positive value indicating
the size of the message associated with the product.  Also, a pointer
to the product data is returned in buf.  Memory is automatically
allocated if a match is found.  The user is responsible for freeing buf
when it is no longer needed.  On error, a value less than or equal to
0 is returned.

ORPGDBM_query() is used to query the ORPG Products Database for a
specific product or group of products.  The structure data is used
to pass in the query information.  The array structure contains two
elements: field and value.  The number of query items must be
specified by data_len.  The user can limit the number of matches
returned using max_list_size.  The query data are returned in the
structure db_info.  If the user wants to set search mode parameters,
then the first element in the query information should have the field
element set to ORPGDBM_MODE and the value element set to the mode
parameters desired.  The mode parameters value can be set by "oring"
the mode macros defined in orpgdbm.h.  

The following query field macros are defined (see rpgdbm.h):

	RPGP_RETENT,		/* retention time in minutes */
	RPGP_VOLT,		/* volume time in julian seconds */
	RPGP_PCODE,		/* product code (16 - 90) */
	PRPG_ELEV,		/* elevation*10 */
	PRPG_WAREHOUSED		/* warehoused product id */

These additional query field macros are defined (see orpgdbm.h):
        ORPGDBM_VOL_TIME_RANGE  /* range of volume times */
                                /* for this option, a second value (value2) must
                                   be specified in the query */

The following query mode macros are defined (see orpgdbm.h):

	ORPGDBM_ALL_MATCH	/* undefined field mathces any value */
	ORPGDBM_EXACT_MATCH	/* undefined field value matches     *
				 * undefined value only (default)    */
	ORPGDBM_FULL_SEARCH	/* find all records. */
	ORPGDBM_PARTIAL_SEARCH	/* find only enough records to satisfy *
				 * user requested limit. */
	ORPGDBM_HIGHEND_SEARCH	/* Search from newest to oldest */
	ORPGDBM_LOWEND_SEARCH	/* Search from oldest to newest (default) */
	ORPGDBM_DISTINCT_FIELD_VALUES	/* search for distinct query values */
	ORPGDBM_ALL_FIELD_VALUES	/* search all query field values *
					 * (default). */

EXAMPLE

In the following example, the user wants to query the ORPG Products
Database for all unique times so the application can build a list
of unique times for selection in a list widget.  The query data are
to be ordered in descending order with the newest time first.

	...

	#include <orpgdbm.h>

	...

	RPG_prod_rec_t		db_info [MAX_PRODUCTS_IN_LIST];
	ORPGDBM_query_data_t	query_data [MAX_PRODUCTS_IN_LIST];

	...

	query_data[0].field = ORPGDBM_MODE;
	query_data[0].value = ORPGDBM_FULL_SEARCH | ORPGDBM_HIGHEND_SEARCH |
			      ORPGDBM_DISTINCT_FIELD_VALUES;
	query_data[1].field = RPGP_VOLT;
	query_data[1].value = 0;	/* Unused */

	ORPGDBM_query (db_info,
		       query_data,
		       2,
		       MAX_PRODUCTS_IN_LIST);
