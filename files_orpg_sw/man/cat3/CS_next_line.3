NAME
CS_next_line - return the specified token from the next cfg line 

SYNOPSIS
#include <infr.h>
int CS_next_line (int tok, int buf_size, char *buf);

DESCRIPTION

Function CS_next_line returns the "tok"-th token in the next line in the 
configuration text after the entry accessed by the previous CS_int_entry, 
CS_name_entry, or CS_next_line. If "tok" <= 0, the entire line is returned. 
Note that CS_next_line returns the very first token in the line as the 
first token while CS_int_entry and CS_name_entry return the token after 
the key as the first token. This function can be used for reading multiple 
line configuration entries.

On success CS_next_line returns the length, in number of bytes, of the 
string in "buf". Otherwise it returns one of the following negative 
numbers:

CS_TOK_NOT_FOUND - The "tok"-th token was not found;	CS_BUF_TOO_SMALL - The string returned was truncated;	CS_NO_PREVIOUS_ENTRY - There was no previous successful entry read; 
		Returning CS_BUF_TOO_SMALL or 		  	   
		CS_TOK_NOT_FOUND is
		considered successful in this regard.
CS_END_OF_TEXT - The end of text has been reached.
