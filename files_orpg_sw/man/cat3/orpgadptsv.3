orpgadptsv(3)		ORPG Adaptation Server 				orpgadptsv(3)

     The ORPG adaptation server is a set of API functions that are accessed
     using remote procedure calls.  Many of the ORPGADPT api calls invoke
     ORPGADPTSV calls to do their work.  The adaptation server is only executed
     when one of its API functions are called.  Each client process that
     indirectly calls an ORPGADPTSV function causes an rssd child process
     to be spawned.  The child process is the adaptation server for that
     process until that process terminates.  These server processes are often
     executed remotely across machines.  So, for example, if a user executes
     a "save_adapt -o rpg" command on the mscf to save the rpg's adaptation
     data from the mscf, then the save_adapt command executing on the mscf
     machine will cause an orpg adaptation server to be spawned on the
     RPG.  The server will build the RPG adaptation archive, and write
     it to the target directory on the mscf using remote procedure calls.
     All ORPG adaptation server processes can be monitored on a given
     machine by typing "lelb_mon orpgadptsv".  Details for a
     given adaptation server function are often shown in the log.
