NAME
LB_read - read a message from a Linear Buffer (LB) file

SYNOPSIS
#include <lb.h>
int LB_read (int lbd, char *buf, int buflen, LB_id_t id) 

DESCRIPTION
LB_read reads the message of message id "id" and copies it to the 
buffer "buf" if the size of the buffer "buflen" is sufficient for 
the message. If the message does not exist, it fails and returns 
an error code. If there are multiple messages in the LB with the 
same "id", the latest one is read.

If "buflen" is smaller than the message length, the first "buflen" 
bytes of the message is copied to "buf" and LB_read returns 
LB_BUF_TOO_SMALL. This feature can be used for reading the first 
part of a message.

If "id" is LB_NEXT, LB_read reads the message pointed 
by the read-pointer (the next message in sequential reading). If 
the next message is not yet available, the function returns 
LB_TO_COME, which is 0. If the message is expired, it returns 
LB_EXPIRED.

If LB_read is successful or it is failed due to LB_BUF_TOO_SMALL or  
LB_EXPIRED, the read pointer will be set to pointing to the next 
message.

On success, LB_read returns the length of the message read. On 
failure, it returns LB_TO_COME as described earlier or a negative 
value indicating one of the following error conditions:

	LB_NOT_FOUND:		The message of "id" was not found.
	LB_BAD_ARGUMENT:	One of the arguments does not make 
				sense.
	LB_BAD_DESCRIPTOR:	Unopened or closed LB descriptor is 
				used.
	LB_INTERNAL_ERROR:	An internal inconsistency is found. 
				The LB is damaged due to unknown reason.
	LB_EXPIRED:		The message is expired.
	LB_BUF_TOO_SMALL:	"buflen" is smaller than the message 
				length.
	LB_PARITY_ERROR:	The user's LB data structure (not the 
				LB) is corrupted by 
				the caller due to a memory leak.
	LB_SHMDT_FAILED:	Failed in shmdt system call.
	LB_LOCK_FAILED:		Failed in a lock system call.
	LB_MMAP_FAILED:		Failed in mmap system call.
	LB_MPROTECT_FAILED:	Failed in mprotect system call.
