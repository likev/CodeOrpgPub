NAME
LE_lb_name - direct log-error messages to a linear buffer file

SYNOPSIS
#include <infr.h>
void LE_lb_name (char *lb_name);

DESCRIPTION
If a linear buffer file (LB) is to be used for log-error message
output, LE_lb_name and LE_init must be called prior to calling
LE_send_msg.

LE_lb_name can only be called once. The second call to this function
will be ignored. If LE_lb_name is never called, the lb library is not 
required in the link time.

When messages are sent to an LB, at most 4 messages can be sent per second.
If a process tries to send more messages, it will be blocked in function
LE_send_msg until the next second.

In the following cases LE routines will print an error message on the
standard output and terminate the process when an LB is used:

        The message LB name is not specified;
        The LB can not be opened for writing;
        LE_send_msg can not write a message to the LB.

SEE ALSO
LE_init(3), LE_send_msg(3)

NOTES
If the process runs in the background, one may choose to redirect the
stdout to a file in order to track the error messages in case that the
LE LB is not accessible.
