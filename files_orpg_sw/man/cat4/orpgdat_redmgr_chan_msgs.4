NAME
   ORPGDAT_REDMGR_CHAN_MSGS - Redundant manager inter-process messages


DESCRIPTION
        This datastore is a replaceable LB used by the redundant managers on the two
        channels for inter-process communication (IPC) and control. The message ids are
        defined in header file orpgred.h in the "redundant channel manager LB message
        ids" section. There are three general types of messages defined: 1) the channel
        status messages of the local and redundant channels (defined as structure
        Channel_status_t); 2) IPC messages that are used to verify the RPG-RPG link,
        change the state of various RPG and RDA state variables, and commands to direct
        the redundant channel to download data to its RDA (defined as structure
        Redundant_channel_msg_t); 3) the previous state message which contains channel
        state information of the local channel at system shutdown (defined as structure
        Previous_channel_state_t).

        The channel status messages contain RPG and RDA status information for each channel.
        The local channel data is collected periodically by the local channel's redundant
        manager. The redundant channel status data is collected by the redundant channel's
        redundant manager. Both channels send each other their own channel status message
        when certain conditions are met and at fixed intervals.

        The functionality of the IPC messages vary depending on the IPC message type so its
        message structure is defined in a general sense where each field is defined as
        parameter1 through parameter5. The first parameter specifies what type of IPC
        message it is (e.g. an inter-channel command, a ping message, etc.). The other
        parameters may or may not have relevant data since they are dependent on the IPC
        message type specified.
