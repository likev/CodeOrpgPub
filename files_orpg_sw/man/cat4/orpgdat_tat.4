ORPGDAT_TAT(4)              ORPG SDD Manpage                  ORPGDAT_TAT(4)

NAME
   ORPGDAT_TAT - Operational (LB) Task Attribute Table (TAT)

DESCRIPTION
       This LB holds the "operational" version of the RPG Task
       Attribute Table (TAT).

       Each message in this LB corresponds to the TAT entry for a given
       Task ID.  The LB message IDs map directly to the corresponding
       Task IDs.  That is, message ID N holds the TAT entry for Task ID N.

       See orpgtat.h for message formats.

       Refer to the ASCII TAT for a description of the TAT entries.

       The initial release of the RPG software will not support dynamic
       update of the LB TAT.  If this functionality is added in a future
       release, we may use an event to drive client processes to re-read
       the LB TAT as necessary following a dynamic update.
