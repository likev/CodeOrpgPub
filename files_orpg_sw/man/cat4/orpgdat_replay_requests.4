NAME
   ORPGDAT_REPLAY_REQUESTS - Replay Request messages

DESCRIPTION
        This LB contains messages from the one time request handler to the
        scheduler for replay products. All products that
        the requests depend on should also be requested in the message.
        
        Each message consists of one or more requests (Prod_request
        defined in prod_request.h) containing the product ID and all
        parameters needed to generate the product.
        
        There are two types assigned to the request, ALERT_OT_REQUEST,
        and USER_OT_REQUEST.  ALERT_OT_REQUEST insures that the product
        is generated from the warehoused data with the volume number
        specified in vol_seq_num; this insures that alert products
        come from the same volume data that generated the alerts.
        USER_OT_REQUEST responses can come from the current or the
        previous volume scan's data.
        
        The replay scheduler will attempt to generate the product
        from warehoused data, and respond on the ORPGDAT_REPLAY_RESPONSES
        LB.
