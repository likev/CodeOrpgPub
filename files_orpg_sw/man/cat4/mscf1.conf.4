mscf1.conf(4)            MSCF Configuration File	    mscf1.conf(4)

NAME
    mscf1.conf - configuration file for mscf.1 application (NWS).

DESCRIPTION
    mscf1.conf is a cs.3 format file.  Comments are allowed.

    The "Start_rpg_command:"  entry contains a command that will start the RPG
    HCI when the RPG HCI button is selected on the mscf screen.

    The "Start_rda_command:" entry contains a command that will start
    the RDA HCI when the RDA HCI button is selected on the mscf screen.

    The "Start_bdds_command:"  entry contains a command that will start the BDDS
    HCI when the BDDS HCI button is selected on the mscf screen.

    The "Output_file_name:" entry contains the path of a temporary file
    used by the mscf application.  The temporary file is used to store
    the results of various SNMP commands executed in the mscf application.

    The "Power_control_device_address:" entry contains the name or IP address
    of the power control administrator.  This address is used as the first
    %s parameter of Pc_cmd for up to 8 power outlets.

    The "Pc_cmd:"  entry contains the command that will be issued whenever the
    user chooses an "On", "Off", or "Reboot" command for any of the 8 power
    outlets on the power control screen.  This command string can contain up to
    three parameters supplied by the mscf application.  "%s" identifies each
    string parameter.  "%d" identifies each integer parameter.  The first
    parameter is a string that is the address of the power administrator (- the
    contents of the "Power_control_device_address" entry).  The second parameter
    is an integer power outlet number (1-8).  The third parameter is the outlet
    command (1=on, 2=off, 3=reboot).  Zero or more parameters may be specified
    in the command string in the correct order.

    The "Pc_key:" and "Pc_ret_strs:" entries contain the outlet label text and the
    outlet command response strings returned when each power control command is
    executed.  Each power control command is expected to return outlet label text
    followed by an outlet number which is then followed by outlet command information.
    For example, if "Pc_key:" equals "outlet" and "PC_ret_strs:" contains "outletOn(",
    "outletOff(", "outletReboot(", then the results of an "on" command should be
    of the form "outlet N outletOn(".  N is the outlet number.  outletOn( indicates
    the on command was executed.

    The "Pn_cmd:"  entry specifies the command that will get the names of the
    power outlets.  The "Pn_key:"  entry is the text that precedes the returned
    power outlet names when the command is executed.  For example, if "Pn_cmd:"
    is equal to "get_power_controller_names" and "Pn_key:"  is "names", then the
    mscf application will retrieve the outlet names by executing the
    "get_power_controller_names" command.  It will expect a string of the form
    "names outlet1 outlet2 ..."  where outlet1, outlet2 are the names of the 8
    power controller outlets separated by spaces.

    The "Ps_cmd:", "Ps_ret_strs:", and "Ps_key:" entries specify the command to
    retrieve power status information, the status return strings, and a key
    string the precedes the power status information for each outlet.  For
    example, if "Ps_cmd:" is set to "get_power_status", "Ps_ret_strs:" is set
    to "on" "off", and "Ps_key:" is set to "outlet_status.", then the mscf
    application would execute the "get_power_status" command every time
    power status information was needed (typically every 10 seconds).  It
    would expect power status results of the form "outlet_status.1 on
    outlet_status.2 off ... outlet_status.8 on".  Each Ps_key: entry is
    followed by an outlet number and one of the possible Ps_ret_strs: values.

    The Pc_host_name_N:, Pc_host_shutdown_cmd_N:, and Pc_host_shutdown_delay_N:
    entries are optional entries that provide command information for gracefully
    shutting down a machine that is connected to power outlet N.  If specified,
    the Pc_host_shutdown_cmd_N:  will be executed whenever power outlet N is
    rebooted or turned off.  If the Pc_host_shutdown_cmd_N:  contains a %s, the
    %s will be replaced with the value of the "Pc_host_name_N:"  entry.  Once
    the graceful shutdown command has been executed, the mscf application will
    wait M seconds before executing the actual power outlet reboot or off
    command where M is the value of the Pc_host_shutdown_delay_N:  entry.  For
    example, if power outlet 3 was connected to machine xyz, and the command for
    gracefully shutting down the xyz machine was powerdown_host -m xyz, and the
    xyz machine needs 30 seconds to gracefully shutdown before the power is cut
    off to the machine, then the following settings could be used to force a
    graceful shutdown of the xyz machine:

    #  Gracefully power down the xyz machine before rebooting or turning of the
    #  master switch for outlet 3
    Pc_host_name_1: xyz
    Pc_host_shutdown_cmd_1: "powerdown_host -m %s"
    Pc_host_shutdown_delay_1: 30

    The Pc_cmd_disable_N:  entries are optional entries for disabling one or
    more power control commands for power outlet N.  Each entry contains a list
    of the commands that will be disabled for outlet N.  "on" disables the turn
    outlet on command.  "off" disables the turn outlet off command.  "reboot"
    disables the reboot outlet command.  For example, the settings to disable
    the on and off command on outlets 3 and 4, and disable all commands on
    outlet 7 would be:

    #  Disable on and off for outlets 3 and 4
    Pc_cmd_disable_3: "on off"
    Pc_cmd_disable_4: "on off"
    Pc_cmd_disable_7: "on off reboot"

    The Hsw_file_name:  entry is the name of the le.3 log file that contains
    hardware trap information that is reported on the main masc trap screen.
    Just like other log files, the location of the trap log file is controlled
    by LE_DIR_EVENT environment variable.  The mscf application checks to see if
    the trap log is updated every second.  Any new trap information is placed
    into the scroll list on the main screen.

    The Hsw_buf_size:  entry controls the size of the circular buffer that
    contains trap information reported on the mscf main screen.

    The Hsw_max_data_size: entry is obsolete.

    The Red_hsw_patterns: entry contains a list of one more strings that will cause
    a trap to be highlighted in red.  If a trap entry contains any of the strings
    specified in this entry, it will be highlighted red.

    The Green_hsw_patterns: entry contains a list of one more strings that will cause
    a trap to be highlighted in green.  If a trap entry contains any of the strings
    specified in this entry, it will be highlighted green.

    The Show_selections:  entry contains a list of "filter" entries shown on the
    bottom of the mscf screen.  Each filter entry contains a title and a list of
    filter values.  Each title will be shown in the filter drop down box.  When
    a filter is selected from the drop down box, trap log messages with the
    specified filter values are shown on the mscf screen.  For example, the
    entries below would put filters for "All_Messages" and "Critical" messages
    in the filter drop down box.  The "All_messages" filter would select all
    traps that contain an empty string (in other words, all traps).  The
    "Critical" messages filter would select all traps that contained "Link Up"
    or "Link Down".

       # entries in the "Show" selection
       Show_selections:
       {

          # All messages are selected
          All_Messages	""

          # HSW critical info pattern
          Critical		"Link Down" "Link Up"
       }

    The Cs_device_N entries contain title and command information for each
    communications device monitored by the mscf.1 application.  The Name:  entry
    of each Cs_device_N entry will be shown in the Device drop down list on
    Comms Status screen in the mscf.1 application.  The Command:  entry and one
    or more "Col_0:"  through "Col_16:"  entries are used to describe the
    command(s) and information returned for each piece of comms status
    information.  The Command:  entry contains the base command used to retrieve
    each piece of status information.  Each Col_M:  entry contains the title and
    specific command for a particular piece of comm status information.  The
    specific command information is appended to the base command to build a
    command to retreive each piece of comms status information.  The retrieved
    status information will be shown in a column with the specified title.  For
    example, the configuration text below defines a "CISCO Switch" comms device
    with a base command "get_comms_status" and 4 specific comm status
    information commands to get specific comms status fields:

     Cs_device_1:
     {
         Name:	"CISCO Router"
         Command:	"get_comms_status"
         Col_0:	"             Device Name"	DeviceName
         Col_1:	" OpStatus"			OperateStatus
         Col_2:	"         Description"		Description
         Col_3:	"  Collisions"			Collisions
     }

   This configuration will cause 4 commands to be executed by the mscf.1
   application every time comms status information is needed for the
   "CISCO Router" comms device:

	get_comms_status DeviceName
        get_comms_status OperateStatus
        get_comms_status Description
        get_comms_status Collisions

   Each command will return information that will be shown in the
   following columns on the screen:

	"             Device Name"
	"      Op Status	 "
        "     Description        "
        "     Collisions"
