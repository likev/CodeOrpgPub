NAME
   ORPGDAT_CM_RESPONSE - Comm_manager response message queue

DESCRIPTION
    ORPGDAT_CM_RESPONSE defines a set of response queues for putting
    comm_manager responses. Each comms line has a response message queue
    implemented with data store of "ORPGDAT_CM_RESPONSE + line_number". A
    comm_manager instance puts response and comm_manager event messages in the
    response message queue for each line managed by it. Each response is a data
    structure of CM_resp_struct defined in comm_manager.h.

    liborpg's orpgcmi module has functions for returning the response data
    store ID for a given comms line.

    If specified in the comms link configuration, event ORPGEVT_NB_COMM_RESP is
    posted by the comm_manager when a response is queued.
