NAME
   ORPGDAT_MRPG_CMDS - mrpg command queue

DESCRIPTION
    This data store is a sequential LB for queuing the mrpg commands. Each
    message is a data structure of Mrpg_cmd_t. The sender field in the struct
    is currently not used. To send a command to mrpg, one writes such a data
    struct to ORPGDAT_MRPG_CMDS. liborpg's orpgmgr module also provides
    functions for sending such command. Refer to mrpg.h and mrpg(1) for details
    on the mrpg commands and data structure Mrpg_cmd_t.
