NAME
rms_output - Input messages form the FAA/RMMS


DESCRIPTION :

        This Linear Buffer is used to store messages from the ORPG/RMS to the
        FAA/RMMS. The ORPG/RMS interface writes a message to the output buffer
        in the form of a string of 7 bit unsigned bytes. The first 18 bytes
        contain the message header. The interface then posts an event to alert
        the port manager that a message has been written to the linear buffer.
        The port manager reads the message and then sends it to the FAA/RMMS.

        This is a local linear buffer used only by the ORPG/RMS interface. It is
        created when the interface is initialized and removed when the interface
        is shutdown. The linear buffer is cleared during a "reset" to remove any
        old messages. The linear buffer is located in the "tmp" directory.

EVENTS:
        ORPGEVT_RMS_SEND_MSG - Is called when the ORPG/RMS places a
        message in the rms_output linear buffer.

        ORPGEVT_RESET_RMS - When posted with an argument of "reset" the linear
        buffer is cleared of all old messages. When posted with an argument of
        "close" the linear buffer is removed.
