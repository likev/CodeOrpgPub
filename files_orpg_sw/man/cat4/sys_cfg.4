NAME
sys_cfg - ORPG system configuration file

DESCRIPTION
      A cs(3) format file that defines numeric IDs associated with each ORPG data store.
   Applications use the orpgda(3) API to access ORPG data stores using numeric data
   ids.  Constant identifiers are defined for each data store in the orpgdat.h
   include file.  This file is generated by mrpg(1) from information contained in
   the data_tables(4) and product_tables(4) configuration files.  The link number for
   the wideband link is also included in this file.  The contents of this file
   is a list of integer data store IDs and the associated file path for each ORPG
   data store.  Each data store ID and path must be on the same line.  The wideband
   link number is defined by the contents of the RDA_link variable.  Since this file,
   environment variables can be referenced from the data defined in this file.
