NAME
   ORPGDAT_OT_REQUEST - One Time Request messages

DESCRIPTION
        This LB contains messages for the one time request handler to process.
        The message ID indicates which p_server instance the one time request
        came from and which instance the reply should go to, (e.g. message
        ID 3 came from p_server number 3).  The special ID for request
        messages coming from the alert process is ALERT_OT_REQ_MSGID; 
        and the reply in this case will go to the p_server
        instance number based on the line number (line_ind) in the message.

        Each message consists of a message header (Pd_msg_header defined in
        prod_user_msg.h), followed by zero or more requests (Pd_request_products
        also defined in prod_user_msg.h).  When there are zero requests, then
        the message is to cancel all outstanding requests from the line number
        specified in the header.

        Requests from the alert process differs from the requests from p_server
        in that the "time" field in the request represents the volume scan number
        instead of the time of product generation. This is used to insure
        that the product sent comes from the same volume scan that generated
        the alert.
        
        The ORPGEVT_OT_REQUEST event is posted when a new message is written
        to this LB.
