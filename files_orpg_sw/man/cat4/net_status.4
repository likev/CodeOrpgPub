NAME
net_status - Network status information

DESCRIPTION
      A named object store (see ocnamedobjstore(3)) that contains connectivity
   status information for every node monitored by mnet(1).  Each named entry in
   the named object store is the name of the node being monitored.  The object
   stored in each named entry is an instance of the orpgnetclient(3) class that
   contains connectivity status information for that node.  mnet(1) creates or
   re-creates this data store when it is started.  If the WORKDIR environment
   variable is defined, this data store is created with the name $WORKDIR/
   net_status.lb.  Otherwise, this data store is created with the name $HOME/
   tmp/net_status.lb.  Since this data store is a named object store, the
   nmstor_info(1) and nmstor_mon(1) utilities can be used to dump its contents
   or monitor the data store for changes.  This data store should be accessed
   from programs using the orpgnet(3) api.
