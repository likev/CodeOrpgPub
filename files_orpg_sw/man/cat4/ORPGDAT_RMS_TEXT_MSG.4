NAME
ORPGDAT_RMS_TEXT_MSG - ORPG/RMS free text messages


DESCRIPTION :

        This Linear Buffer contains the free text messages entered in the HCI
        for transmission to the FAA/RMMS. The messages can contain embedded
        control characters, and any alphanumeric combination.  The size can
        vary up to a maximum of 400 characters.

        When a message is placed in the linear buffer, an event is posted by the
        HCI to alert the ORPG/RMS interface that a message is waiting. The
        interface reads the message, attaches a time stamp and sends it to the
        FAA/RMMS.

        The HCI is the only writer to the linear buffer and the ORPG/RMS
        interface is the only reader.


EVENTS:
        ORPGEVT_RMS_TEXT_MSG - Is called when the HCI places a message in the
        ORPGDAT_RMS_TEXT_MSG linear buffer.
