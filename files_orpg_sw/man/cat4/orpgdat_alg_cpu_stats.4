NAME

   ORPGDAT_ALG_CPU_STATS - RPG algorithm CPU statistics
   
DESCRIPTION

   This data store is a replaceable LB that contains RPG algorithm CPU
   statistics.  The structure of this data is described in header file
   cpc000/alg_cpu_stats.h.  The LB message IDs correspond to the reporting
   task's task ID.

   This information is updated by the RPG/RPGC library at the end of volume
   scan and reports the CPU utilization in various forms (e.g., CPU secs/volume, 
   CPU secs/elevation) and well as the number of elevation scans processed for
   the previous volume scan.

   Currently this information is not used nor is there any mechanism to 
   display this information.  It is anticipated that this information will
   eventually be used in support of CPU scheduling.
