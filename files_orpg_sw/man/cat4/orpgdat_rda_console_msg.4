DESCRIPTION

    This data store is a non-replaceable LB that contains RDA console messages.
    RDA console messages sent from the RDA to the RPG are written to this
    data store by the control RDA task.  The number of messages which can exist
    at a given time is defined in "data_tables".  When the maximum number of
    messages has been reached, new messages overwrite the oldest message.
    Each message is of the structure RDA_RPG_console_message_t from
    rda_rpg_console_message.h.
