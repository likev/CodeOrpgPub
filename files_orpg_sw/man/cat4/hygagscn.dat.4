NAME
HYGAGSCN.DAT - Precipitation Gage Accumulation Scan Data File
               (a.k.a. Hydromet Precipitation Adjustment Data Base File)

FILETYPE
Disk File

DESCRIPTION
The legacy file is implemented in the ORPG as a disk file.

This file is maintained and accessed by cpc013 tsk006 prcpadju
(Precipitation Adjustment Algorithm)

Legacy RPG I/O for this file is supported by replacement ANSI 77 code
placed directly in the legacy Fortran source files.

The disk file is opened as a direct-access file with a record length that
corresponds to the largest I/O performed by the legacy RPG code (82,800
bytes).

The legacy RPG file a313h.inc has been modified to provide record numbers
that are passed as arguments to the ANSI 77 READ and WRITE routines.

The structure of the file is as follows (refer to a313h.inc and the legacy
RPG routines listed below):

                                                Length
        Record                                  (bytes)
        -----------------------------------     -------
         1 Bias Values and Times                   36
         2 Beginning Date and Time of Scan          8
         3 Scan Data                            82800

Since each record is 82,800 bytes in length, we are "wasting" 165,556
bytes of this 248,400 byte disk file (67%) with this approach.

Refer to the following legacy RPG routines:

        A31361__PRECIP_ADJUST
        A3136R__READ_ACUMSCAN
        A3136T__INIT_TIMES
        A3136W__WRT_ACUMSCAN
        A313M6__PRECIP_ADJUSTMENT
