NAME:
        hreet.lb - High Resolution Enhanced Echo Tops (EET) Final Volume Output Product 

DESCRIPTION :
        The hreet linear buffer contains the product header and digitally 
	encoded echo tops data for the high resolution EET final volume product.
        The product is output from the High Resolution Enhanced Echo Tops
	(HREET) algorithm task (hireseet) at the completion of each 
	volume.
        
        The product contains the encoded EET values from the algorithm.  The
	data are mapped to a "flat polar" 360 radials by 345 gates projection.
        
        The product header contains virtually all of the original header
	information provided by COMBBASE (96) as passed along via DQA (297).  
	Additional information, such as the number of radials in this 
	intermediate buffer that were found to have AD by the DQA algorithm, 
	whether spot blanking was used anywhere in the original volume data,
	the maximum EET computed in the volume, and the dBZ threshold value 
	used are provided.
