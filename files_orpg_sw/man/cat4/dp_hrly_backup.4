NAME:
        Dual Pol Hourly Backup Data Store

DESCRIPTION:
        The DP_HRLY_BACKUP.DAT data store contains two circular queues
        of metadata for the hourly backup (LB_id_t HOURLY_ID), and the
        hourly difference backup (LB_id_t HOURLY_DIFF_ID). The format is
        a Circular_Queue_t structure defined in include/dp_lt_accum_types.h

        The hourly circular queue with LB_id_t HOURLY_ID is tied to
        the accumulation buffers in the DP_HRLY_ACCUM data store.

        The hourly difference circular queue with LB_id_t HOURLY_DIFF_ID
        is tied to the accumulation buffers in the DP_DIFF_ACCUM data store.
