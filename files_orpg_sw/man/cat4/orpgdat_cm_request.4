NAME
   ORPGDAT_CM_REQUEST - Comm_manager request message queue

DESCRIPTION
    ORPGDAT_CM_REQUEST defines a set of request queues for putting comm_manager
    requests. Each comm_manager instance has a request message queue
    implemented with data store of "ORPGDAT_CM_REQUEST +
    comm_manager_instance_number". comm_manager requests on all lines managed
    by the comm_manager instance are put in the same message queue. The
    comm_manager instance reads and processes the requests sequencially. Each 
    request is a data structure of CM_req_struct defined in comm_manager.h.

    liborpg's orpgcmi module has functions for returning the request data store
    ID for a given comms line.

    If specified in the comms link configuration, event ORPGEVT_NB_COMM_REQ is
    posted by the comm_manager request sender when a request is queued.
