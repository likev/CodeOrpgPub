NAME
   GAGEDATA - Rain Gage Data Base File

INITIALIZATION
   Initialization is performed by the maintenance task mnttsk_hydromet 
   at RPG startup if the Rain Gage data does not exist.    

DESCRIPTION
   The legacy Rain Gage Data Base file is implemented in the RPG as a
   product, GAGEDATA.

   The corresponding LB file must reside on disk, as this database should
   survive restarts.

   Legacy RPG I/O for this file is supported by the replacement SYSIO 
   routine in the RPG library.  The legacy RPG software is modified to
   use the faux-buffer number GAGEDATA as the I/O logi  RPG I/O for this
   file is also supported by the LB and ORPGDA library routines.

   The C equivalent to the legacy Fortran data structure is defined in 
   cpc000 gagedata.h.

   The file is updated during the course of RPG processing by the rgagedb
   process.  This process updates the gage data base upon receipt of 
   the Precipitation Status Message product PRCIPMSG.
