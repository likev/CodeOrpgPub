NAME:
        hrvil.lb - High Resolution VIL Final Volume Output Product 

DESCRIPTION :
        The hrvil linear buffer contains the product header and digitally 
	encoded VIL data for the high resolution VIL final volume product.
        The product is output from the High Resolution Vertically Integrated
	Liquid (HRVIL) algorithm task (hiresvil) at the completion of each 
	volume.
        
        The product contains the encoded VIL values from the algorithm.  The
	data are mapped to a "flat polar" 360 radials by 460 gates projection.
        
        The product header contains virtually all of the original header
	information provided by COMBBASE (96) as passed along via DQA (297).  
	Additional information, such as the number of radials in this 
	intermediate buffer that were found to have AD by the DQA algorithm, 
	whether spot blanking was used anywhere in the original volume data,
	and the maximum VIL (encoded) computed in the volume are provided.
