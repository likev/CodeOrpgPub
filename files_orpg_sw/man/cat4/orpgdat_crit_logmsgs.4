NAME
   ORPGDAT_CRIT_LOGMSGS - RPG Critical Log Messages
    
DESCRIPTION 
	This LB contains critical log messages from all ORPG tasks.

        The log messages are intercepted or gathered by Monitor RPG (MRPG).

        The vehicle for "intercepting" critical log messages is the
        critical LE message event message (i.e., an event message posted by
        the LE library).  Each instance of MRPG registers for the critical
        LE message event code, which is identified by the LE_DIR_EVENT
        environment variable.  Each instance of MRPG processes only those
        events posted on the local node (i.e., each instance of MRPG is
        interested only in those critical log messages generated by the
        tasks it is monitoring on the local node).

        MRPG also "polls" the local-node task LE LB files, gathering any
        critical log messages that it may have missed.
