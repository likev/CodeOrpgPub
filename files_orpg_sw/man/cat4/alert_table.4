alert_table(4)           Alert Threshold Information		    alert_table(4)

DESCRIPTION

The alert_table DEA file contains Alert_threshold_categories entries.  The
Alert_threshold_categories entry defines the Alert categories.

Each entry in the Alert Threshold Table is defined by a set of attributes
(name, group, category, thresh, prod_type, prod_code).  The attributes are
described below.

name       - the name of the parameter (string)

group      - the group number associated with the entry.  Group
             numbers are defined by the Alert Threshold Group table
             which follows this table.  Refer to that table for
             specific values.

category   - the unique category number (positive integer)

thresh     - a signed integer array representing the threshold values.

prod_type  - identifies whether the entry can be paired with a volume based
             product (1), elevation based product (2), or a hydromet
             product (4).  NOTE:  These values correspond to a unique
             bit and are not mutually exclusive.

prod_code  - the ID of the paired product to this entry.  NOTE:  Elevation
             type entries can only be paired with elevation type
             products and volume type entries can only be paired with
             volume type products.  The product type is defined in the
             product attributes table.  The alert item in the product
             attributes table determines if the product can be paired
             to an alert threshold item.
