NAME
   ORPGDAT_ADAPT - ORPG Adaptation Data

DESCRIPTION
   This LB contains legacy Adaptation Data messages.  Although most
   legacy adaptation data blocks have been eliminated, a few remain.
   Two of the remaining blocks (Alert thresholds and color tables)
   contain duplicate information that is updated from the corresponding
   ORPG adaptation data.  Two of the remaining blocks (environment and
   rda adaptation data) are never modified so the original legacy blocks
   are still initialized using FORTRAN data statements (see
   adapt_data_gen.1 and adapt_data.1).  Each adaptation message
   is listed below:

   Message ID  |  Structure         | Defined in	Description
      ALRTAD   |  alert_threshold_t | alert_threshold.h	Alert Thresholds
      COLRTBL  |		    | a309adpt.inc	Color Tables
      RDACNT   |  Rdacnt            | rdacnt.h		RDA Adaptation Data
      ENVIRON  |  		    | a309adpt.inc	Environment Adaptation Data
