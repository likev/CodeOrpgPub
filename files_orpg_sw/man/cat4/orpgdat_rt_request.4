NAME

   ORPGDAT_RT_REQUEST - RPG routine product request data
   
DESCRIPTION

   This data store is a sequential LB containing RPG routine product request
   data.  The requests are provided by either the one-time scheduler ps_onetime
   or the product server p_server on behalf of narrowband users.  If the 
   request data is provided by ps_onetime, the requests are one-time requests 
   which must be scheduled one the real-time data stream.  If the request data
   is provided by p_server, the requests are generally routine product sets.  

   The product request data is read by ps_routine for product scheduling 
   purposes.  The format of the data is described in header file prod_user_msg.h.
   The RPG/PUP ICD also contains information on product request format.
