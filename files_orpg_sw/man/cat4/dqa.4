NAME:
        dqa.lb - Data Quality Assurance Intermediate Product 

DESCRIPTION :
        The dqa linear buffer contains the product header and reflectivity
	factor data for the data quality assurance intermediate product.
        The product is output from the Data Quality Assurance (DQA)
        algorithm task (data_qual) at the completion of each elevation.
        
        The product contains the original bit count value of reflectivity
	factor as provided by COMBBASE (96) with any AD or AP radial gates
	found by the algorithm set to zero bit count value.  There is no
	way to distinguish between those reset data and radial gates that
	originally came in from COMBBASE as bit count value zero.
        
        The product header contains virtually all of the original header
	information provided by COMBBASE (96).  Additional information, 
	such as the number of radials in this intermediate buffer, the number
	of radials in this intermediate buffer that were found to have AD, 
	and whether spot blanking was used anywhere in the tilt are provided.
	The description of this intermediate output buffer is noted as 
	structure type DQA_tilt defined in $HOME/src/cpc013/tsk007/dqa_main.h.
	
	Only the most recent 10 elevation scans processed are stored in this
	buffer.
