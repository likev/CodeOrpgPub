NAME
HYACCUMS.DAT - Precipitation Accumulation Scans Data File

FILETYPE
Disk File

DESCRIPTION
The legacy file is implemented in the ORPG as a disk file.

This file is maintained and used by cpc013 tsk005 prcprtac (Precipitation
Rate and Accumulation Algorithms).

Legacy RPG I/O for this file is supported by the LB library modules placed 
directly in the legacy C source files.

The C equivalent to the legacy Fortran data structure is defined in a313h.h.
The legacy RPG file  prcprtac_file_io.h has been provided record numbers
that are passed as arguments to function calls.

The structure of the file is as follows (refer to a313h.h and 
prcprtac_file_io.h):

                                                Length
        Record                                  (bytes)
        -----------------------------------     -------
         1 Rate Scan Header                        24
         2 Period Scans Header                    684
         3 Hourly Accum Scan Header                44
         4 Bad Scan Time-Stamp Array Record        32
         5 Rate Scan Data                       82800
         6 1st Period Scan Data                 82800
                ...
        21 16th Period Scan Data                82800
        22 Hourly Accumulation Scan Data        82800

Since each record is 82,800 bytes in length, we are "wasting" 330,552
bytes of this 1,573,200 byte disk file (21%) with this approach.

Refer to the following legacy RPG C source files:

	prcprate_initialize_file_io.c
	prcprtac_file_io.c
