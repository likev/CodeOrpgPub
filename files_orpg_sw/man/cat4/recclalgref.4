NAME:
        recclalgref.lb - Clutter Likelihood Reflectivity Intermediate Product 

DESCRIPTION :
        The recclalgref linear buffer contains product headers for the
        clutter likelihood reflectivity intermediate products.
        The products are output from the Radar Echo Classifier (REC)
        algorithm task (recclalg) using an anomalous propagation
        (AP)/clutter target.
        
        The product contains the percentage likelihood that the radar
        is detecting AP/ground clutter in each bin of the reflectivity
        radials.
        
        The product header has an element labeled "len".  If the value
        in len is positive it's a pointer to an entry in the product
        data base where the product is stored.  If the value is
        negative it's an abort code. The products in the data base
        are referenced by volume, date/time, and elevation cut.

        NOTE: There is a naming inconsistency between this linear buffer
        and the associated product ID.
