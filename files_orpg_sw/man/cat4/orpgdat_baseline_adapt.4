NAME
   ORPGDAT_BASELINE_ADAPT - ORPG Baseline Adaptation Data

DESCRIPTION
      A named object store ocnamedobjstore that contains the baseline
   copy for each ORPG adaptation data block.  A copy of every object
   contained in orpgdat_adapt(4) is contained in this named object store.
   Refer to orpgdat_adapt(4) for more information on the various objects
   stored in the adaptation object store.  This data store is initialized
   from AscII configuration files by the mnttsk_adapt(1) program.  Several
   hci applications (hci_adapt), hci_spp provide update and restore
   baseline buttons used to copy adaptation to and from the baseline
   adaptation data.
      Since this data store is a named object store, the nmstor_info(1)
   utility can be used to dump the contents of the data store.  The
   nmstor_mon(1) data store can be used to report changes made to the data
   store.
