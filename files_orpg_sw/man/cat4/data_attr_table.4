NAME
data_tables - ORPG data store definitions

DESCRIPTION
   A cs(3) format file that defines public ORPG data stores.  The file contains a
   single Datastore_attr_tbl entry followed by a { } pair.  A list of Datastore
   entries contained within the {} pair defines the public ORPG data stores.
   Within a {} for each Datastore entry is a list of attributes for that
   data store.  The attributes for each data store entry are:

   			Data Store Attributes

   Parameter		Description 			Possible Values
   ============================================================================
   data_id		Unique identifier associated    4 byte integer
			with this data store.
			(required)
   path			Path of the linear buffer or	Up to 1023 characters
			(required)
   persistent	        Indicates that a file is        No additional values	
			persistent.	
			If present, the mrpg -r option	
			on startup will not remove the
			data file.  If not present the
			file will be removed by the
			mrpg -r option.  
   compression		Specifies automatic data	0 denotes no compression, 
			compression on ORPGDA_write	1 denotes bzip2.
			and decompression on 
			ORPGDA_read.
   write_permission     Control write access to LBs.	See format below.
   LB_attr		Linear buffer attributes.	List of attributes
			This parameter or the		contained within a
			File_attr parameter is          {} pair.  See LB
			required.			Attributes below.
							LBs will be created
							/re-created by mrpg(1)
							when necessary.
   File_attr		File attributes.		List of attributes
							for a file contained
							within a {} pair. mrpg(1)
							does not create file
							data stores.


   			Linear Buffer Attributes
		(Contained within {} for an LB_attr entry}

   Parameter		Description 			Possible Values
   ============================================================================
   remark		Remarks about this LB.          string <= 63 characters
			Optional.  Default is the
			product description for
			product LBs (LBs defined
			in product_tables.4).  For
			Non-product LBs, the default
			is "".
   mode			UNIX permissions	        4 byte integer
			value.  Optional.
			Default 0664 octal.
   msg_size		Average message size.		4 byte integer
			Default is the max
			product size for product LBs
			(LBs defined in product_
			tables.4).  For Non-product
			LBs, the default is 0.
			See lb(3) for more info on
			average message sizes for
			linear buffers.
   maxn_msgs		Maximum number of messages.	4 byte integer.
   types		LB type flags.	Each flag is    LB_REPLACE,
			separated by spaces.  Refer	LB_SINGLE_WRITER
			to lb(3) for more information   LB_NO_EXPIRE
			on the meaning of each flag.	LB_UNPROTECTED
							LB_MUST_READ
							LB_FILE
							LB_NORMAL
							LB_DIRECT
							LB_UN_TAG
							LB_MSG_POOL
   tag_size             Number of tag bits 		32-bits.
   nra_size		Size of the active notification	 integer
			request area for LB notification.
			See lb(3) for details about
			nra_size.

   			     File  Attributes
		(Contained within {} for a File_attr entry}

   Parameter		Description 			Possible Values
   ============================================================================
   repository           Path of the file		Up to 1023 characters.

For write permission, the format is as follows: The write permission must be a
CS section enclosed by "{" and "}". Each line in the section specifies a msg_id
followed by a list of task names of tasks allowed write permission. The msg_id
field can be any valid message ID or * to denote all messages other than those
that have explicitly specified permission. "*" in the task name list indicates
all tasks. "CPCxxx", where "xxx" must be an integer, in the task name list
indicates all tasks in the specified cpc. If no write permission is specified
for a data store, write permission for this data store is not checked (every
task can write any message). If, however, write permission is specified for any
of the messages in a data store, all other messages that do not have specified
write permission in the data store are read-only. ORPGDA_write with LB_ANY is
permitted to a data store only when all messages IDs are writable by this task
(or no write permission specification at all).

The following are examples:

    write_permission {
	2	basrflct basvelct
	*	*
    }

This indicates that only tasks "basrflct" and "basvelct" can write message 2
while any process can write any message ID other than 2. ORPGDA_write with 
LB_ANY is permitted by the two list tasks but not permitted by other tasks.

    write_permission {
	2	basrflct 
    }

This indicates that only task "basrflct" can write message 2 while all other message IDs are read-only. ORPGDA_write with LB_ANY is not permitted by any task.

    write_permission {
	2	basrflct *
    }

This indicates that any task can write message 2 while all other message ID are
read-only. ORPGDA_write with LB_ANY is not permitted.

    write_permission {
	*	*
    }

This indicates that any task can write message with any message ID. 
ORPGDA_write with LB_ANY is permitted.


EXAMPLES
      The ORPG distribution contains an example data_tables configuration file.
