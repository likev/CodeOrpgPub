NAME
   HYUSRSEL - Hydromet User Selectable Products Internal Data Base File

INITIALIZATION
   Initialization is performed by maintenance task mnttsk_hydromet at 
   startup if this data does not exist. 

DESCRIPTION
   The legacy Hydromet User Selectable Products Internal Data Base File is
   implemented in the ORPG as the faux-buffer HYUSRSEL in a Linear Buffer file.
   The LB file must reside on disk, as this database must survive restarts.

   Legacy RPG I/O for this file is supported by the replacement SYSIO routine.
   The legacy RPG software is modified to use the faux-buffer number HYUSRSEL
   as the I/O logical unit number.

   ORPG I/O for this file is supported by the LB and ORPGDA library routines.

   The HYUSRSEL messages have fixed message ids that correspond to the (constant)
   legacy RPG USDB Sector Offsets values:

        Message                         ID      Length (bytes)
        ----------------------------    ------  --------------
        Header                          0        1,536
        1st hour of data                6       82,800
        2nd hour of data                330     82,800
                ...
        30th hour of data               9402    82,800
        1st hour of adjusted data       9726    82,800
                ...
        30th hour of adjusted data      19122   82,800
        Default 24-hour data            19446   82,800

   This message id assignment scheme was chosen because the legacy RPG code
   passes the USDB Sector Offsets values to SYSIO.
