NAME:
	mda1d Product

DESCRIPTION:
	The mda1d produces a intermedial product which is expected to
	feed mda2d task. mda1d linear buffer contains following data:
	data type		data
	int			number of shear vectors
	struct Shear_vect	attributes for a shear vector
	...			...
	int			number of radial convergent vectors
	struct Conv_vect        attributes for a radial convergent vector
	...			...

	the data structure for Shear_vect and Conv_vect:

	typedef struct {
 	double range;
  	double beg_azm;
  	double end_azm;
  	double beg_vel;
  	double end_vel;
  	double vel_diff;
  	double shear;
  	double maxgtgvd;
  	double gtg_azm;
  	double rank;
  	} Shear_vect;

 	typedef struct {
 	double azm;
 	double range_max;
 	double range_min;
 	double max_vel;
 	double min_vel;
 	double vel_diff;
 	} Conv_vect;


	
	The linear buffer size is set to 500000 bytes for worst case 
	The actual product size depends on the weather situation.
