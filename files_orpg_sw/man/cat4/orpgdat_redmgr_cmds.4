NAME
   ORPGDAT_REDMGR_CMDS - Redundant Manager commands


DESCRIPTION
        This datastore is a sequential LB that contains command messages intiated by rpg
        application processes and serviced by the redundant manager. The commands direct
        the redundant manager to perform a specific inter-channel update or to command
        the redundant channel to perform a specific update on that channel. The different
        commands are listed in file orpgred.h in the "ORPG-to-redundant manager commands"
        section. There are three general types of commands defined: 1) the update all
        messages command which forces all Adaptation Data to be copied from the local
        channel to the redundant channel; 2) commands to direct the redundant channel to
        download a Clutter Censor Zones file or the Clutter Bypass Map to its RDA;
        3) commands to direct the redundant channel to change the current VCP selection
        or to download a VCP to its RDA.

        The command messages are composed of data structure Redundant_cmd_t defined
        in the ORPGDAT_REDMGR_CMDS section in header file orpgred.h. The cmd field is
        used to specify the command. Any additional information that is needed by
        the redundant manager to service the command is provided in optional fields
        parameter1 through parameter5. Fields lb_id and msg_id are no longer used but
        have been retained in the structure for future use.
