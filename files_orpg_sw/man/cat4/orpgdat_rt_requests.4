DESCRIPTION

	This LB contains messages for the routine request handler to
	process.  The message ID indicates which p_server instance the
	request came from.  The special id for request messages coming
	from the one time request process is OTR_PSERVER_NUMBER.

	Each message consists of a message header (Pd_msg_header defined in
	prod_user_msg.h), followed by zero or more requests (Pd_request_products
	also defined in prod_user_msg.h).
	
EVENTS 

	The ORPGEVT_OT_SCHEDULE_LIST event is posted when a new message
	is written to this LB from the one time request handler.  And
	the ORPGEVT_RT_REQUEST event is posed when a new message is
	written to this LB from the p_server.
