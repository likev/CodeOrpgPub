ORPGDAT_DATASTORE_STATUS(4)     ORPG SDD Manpage    ORPGDAT_DATASTORE_STATUS(4)

NAME
325 ORPGDAT_DATASTORE_STATUS - RPG Datastore Status Information
       
DESCRIPTION 
       This LB holds status for every public datastore in the RPG
       system.  These data are generated by a number of tasks.
       Although this LB has potentially many writers, these updates typically
       occur only during periods of RPG control (e.g., startup, shutdown,
       restart, etc.).

       The messages in this LB file serve two purposes:

           - provide a mechanism for Manage RPG to manage datastores
           - provide information for human troubleshooter


  Manage RPG management of datastores is still in the
  pathfinding stage.  This manpage will not be complete
  until that aspect of Manage RPG has been finalized.
 

       All messages in this LB file share a common structure
       (Orpgstat_ds_stat_msg_t), as defined in orpgstat.h.

       This is an LB_REPLACE LB.  The scheme for assigning message IDs is
       simple: the message ID for the status message of a given datastore
       is simply the Data ID of that datastore.  The presumption is that
       the largest permissible LB message ID is much greater than the largest
       possible Data ID.
