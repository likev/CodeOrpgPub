NAME:
        Hydrometeor Classification Algorithm 

DESCRIPTION :
        HCA output linear buffer contains copies of its input data fields
        from the quality index algorithm (qia) except for the quality
        index values which are replaced by two additional fields:  Hydro
        class types for each sample bin and melting layer top and bottom 
        heights.  The dual polarization data input fields that are passed
        through are processed horizontal reflectivity, processed
        differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient corrected for
        noise,  signal-to-noise ratio in the forizontal channel, processed
        specific differential phase and processed differential phase.

        Radials in this linear buffer are formatted using the Generic_
        moment_t structure defined in generic_basedata.h.
