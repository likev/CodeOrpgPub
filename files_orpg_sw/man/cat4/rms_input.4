NAME
rms_input - Input messages form the FAA/RMMS


DESCRIPTION :

        This Linear Buffer is used to store messages from the FAA/RMMS.
        The rms_ptmgr routine reads a message from the port and writes it to
        the input buffer.  The message is in the form of a string of 7 bit
        unsigned bytes. The first 18 bytes contain the message header. The port
        manager then posts an event to alert the ORPG/RMS that a message has
        been received.  The ORPG/RMS interface reads the message and then
        processes it.

        This is a local linear buffer used only by the ORPG/RMS interface. It is
        created when the interface is initialized and removed when the interface
        is shutdown. The linear buffer is cleared during a "reset" to remove any
        old messages. The linear buffer is located in the "tmp" directory.

EVENTS:
        ORPGEVT_RMS_MSG_RECIEVED - Is called when the port manager places a
        message in the rms_input linear buffer.

        ORPGEVT_RESET_RMS - When posted with an argument of "reset" the linear
        buffer is cleared of all old messages. When posted with an argument of
        "close" the linear buffer is removed.
