NAME
   ORPGDAT_BASELINE_ADAPTATION -  Baseline version of legacy adaptation data

DESCRIPTION
   This LB contains baseline version(s) of legacy Adaptation Data messages.
   Most of the messages stored in the orpgdat_adaptation(4) LB either have
   ORPG baseline and production versions or they are not updated by ORPG.
   Since rda control adaptation information is the only information that is
   updated by ORPG and does not have ORPG baseline and production copies, it
   is the only information kept in the baseline legacy adaptation LB.
   The restore and update from baseline buttons in hci applications that
   update RDA adaptation data access and update this data store.  The
   mnttsk_adapt(1) program will initialize the rda adaptation message of this
   data store if it does not exist.  See orpgdat_adaptation(4) for more
   information on the contents of legacy adaptation messages.
