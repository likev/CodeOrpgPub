DESCRIPTION

The RPG Options file contains descriptions of tasks which can be invoked from
the RPG HCI when the RPG is in defined states.  Typically, it contains 
selections to reinitialize various RPG components when the RPG is shutdown.
However, this can be extended to other RPG states as well.

Notes:   This file can be edited while the RPG is operating.  The  RPG doesn't
need to be restarted.

This file contains a set of special tasks which can be invoked through the HCI
under controlled conditions.  A set of rules have been defined so that the HCI
can dynamically build a set of objects for the user to select from.  A sample
task entry is defined below.

 	Task {
		name 		"Cleanup logs"
		description	"This option removes all log files"
		action		"remove_logs -c"
		state		MRPG_ST_SHUTDOWN
		msg		"This message goes to syslog file"
	}

In the above example, a toggle button with the label "Cleanup logs" would be
added to the HCI window.  It would only be selectable when the RPG is in a
shutdown state.  If the RPG was in a shutdown state and the item was selected,
then the action performed would be to invoke the "remove_logs -c" command using
the "system()" function.

The valid state fields are defined in the header file mrpg.h.  Multiple states
are supported.  Each field must be separated by one or more blanks.  For
example, if one wanted an option to be available in both shutdown and operate
states, the following state entry could be defined:

	state	MRPG_ST_SHUTDOWN MRPG_ST_OPERATING

Multiple actions can be invoked by separating each command by the ";"
character.  For example, if the user wanted to invoke "task1", "task2 -c -f",
and "task3 100" from a single selection they could define the following action
entry:

	action	"task1;task2 -c -f;task3 100"

Refer to the HCI header file "hci_rpg_options.h" for specific limits on the
number of init options entries allowed and the maximum lengths for the
description, action, state, and msg strings.
