NAME
   ORPGDAT_USER_PROFILES - User profile data base

DESCRIPTION
    This data store is a replaceable LB that contains all user profiles. Each
    message, defining a user profile, contains a Pd_user_entry structure
    followed by the following optional lists. The pms_list is an array of
    structure Pd_pms_entry. pms_list specifies the product request permission
    info. dd_list, an array of structure Pd_prod_item, specifies the default
    product distribution table. map_list, an array of prod_id_t, specifies the
    maps distributed to the user. The map distribution is currently not
    implemented. Note that the lists must start at aligned offsets. The data
    structures are defined in prod_distri_info.h.

    Task rpgdbm provides database query support for the user profile database.
    liborpg's orpgnbc provides functions for accessing the user profiles.
    ORPGDAT_USER_PROFILES is initialized by ipi from an ASCII user profile 
    file.
