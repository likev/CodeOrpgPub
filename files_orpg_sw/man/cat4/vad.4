NAME:
       Velocity Azimuth Display: 8 level/5 kts

        The vad linear buffer contains product headers for 8 level/5 kts
        velocity azimuth display products. The product header has an
        element labeled "len".  If the value in len is positive it's a pointer to
        an entry in the product data base where the product is stored.  If the
        value is negative it's an abort code. The products in the data base are
        referenced by volume, date/time, and elevation cut.
