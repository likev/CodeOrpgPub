user_profiles(4)      User Profiles Configuration       user_profiles(4)

   DESCRIPTION
    
       The user_profiles configuration file contains a list of product
       distribution class entries, line user entries, dedicated user entries,
       and dial up user entries.  This configuration file contains product
       distribution controls, line specific information, and user information
       needed for product distribution and status screen displays.  The
       configuration file entries define configuration settings applicable to
       each class, line, dedicated user, and dial up user for the ORPG.  The
       keywords indicate the start of a definition for one of the types, and the
       keywords for each of type are:  Class, Line_user, Dedicated_user, and
       Dial_user.  Also, there are three global parameters defined.

   Global Parameters
   
       The global parameters are given below.  These parameters will be set to
       the default values specified.  The connect_time_limit parameter is a
       global maximum value and cannot be increased by connection time limit
       entries defined in the Class, Line_user, or Dial_user profile entries.

                                Global Parameters

   Class Definition
   
       Class UP entries define the generic class characteristics for product
       distribution and generation.  The settings from a particular class entry
       can be incorporated into the settings of any Line_user, Dedicated_user,
       or Dial_user entry.  The number in the class field of a Line_user,
       Dedicated_user, or Dial_user entry refers to the class entry that will be
       incorporated into a particular entry.  For example, a Dial_user entry
       with a class equal to 1 would incorporte the settings from the class
       entry with its class field set equal to 1.  Any additional settings in
       the Dial_user entry would override the settings in the class entry.  An
       additional connection_time_limit setting for a user entry will be ignored
       if it exceeds the global connection_time_limit setting.  The possible
       fields for class definition entries are defined in the table below.  The
       contents of each class entry are enclosed with {} pairs of braces.  The
       class field is required for each class definition entry.

                        When set to zero, use the global
                        default value. If this time is larger
                        than the global connect_time_limit
                        value, it will be ignored.

       each Line_user entry, the line_ind and class are required.  For a link
       defined as D-in in comms_link.conf(4), the port_password parameter must be
       defined in the corresponding line_user entry in user_profiles.  The
       max_connect_time parameter is optional for dial lines, but, it will be
       ignored if it is larger than the global connect_time_limit setting.  For
       Line_user entries defined as class 4, the distri_method parameter must be
       specified.  The name parameter is optional.  For Line_users defined as
       dedicated, the port_password field is optional.

       Any user entry can incorporate class settings in its Line_user
       specification by including the class field to identify the class
       definition to incorporate.  Although class settings are not generally
       overridden, any class setting may be overridden.  See the fields defined
       in the Class Definition section for more information on the various class
       settings.  If a Line_user entry does not incorporate any class settings
       and the class settings are not defined within the entry, then RPG
       defaults will be used for those settings.  The contents for each user
       entry are enclosed with {} pairs of braces.

   Maximum Connect Time Notes
      Maximum connect time can be defined in several places within this file.
      It is defined globally for the RPG system using the connect_time_limit
      global variable.  It can also be specified for a Line_user, Dial_user, or
      Class definition.  When a user is connected, the minimum connect time
      limit from these 4 possible sources will be used to limit the users
      connect time.  If a user is allowed to override the maximum connect time
      (UP_CD_OVERRIDE in user_profiles) and they request additional time from
      the PUP, then the minimum of the system and line connect_time_limit will
      be used as the limit for that user.  
      
   Dedicated_user and Dial_user Definitions 
      
      The Dedicated_user entries specify profiles for dedicated users.  The
      fields user_id, and user_name fields are required.

      The Dial_user entries specify profiles for dial users.  The fields
      user_id, user_name, and user_password fields are required.  The
      max_connect_time field is optional for a dial user, but it will be ignored
      if it is larger than the global connect_time_limit setting.

      The possible fields for user entries (Dedicated_user or Dial_user) are
      defined in the table below.  Any user entry can incorporate class settings
      in its specification by including the class field to identify the class
      definition to incorporate.  Although class settings are not generally
      overridden, any class setting may be overridden.  See the fields defined
      in the Class Definition section for more information on the various class
      settings.  If a user entry does not incorporate any class settings and the
      class settings are not defined within the entry, then RPG defaults will be
      used for those settings.  The contents for each user entry are enclosed
      with {} pairs of braces.
