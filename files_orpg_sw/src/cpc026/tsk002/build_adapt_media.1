NAME
    build_adapt_media - Build adaptation one or more adaptation media
		         from an adaptation master directory structure.

SYNOPSIS
   build_adapt_media [options] -i input_directory

DESCRIPTION
    Builds one or more adaptation floppies from an adaptation data master
    directory structure. The -i option is used to specify the path of the
    adaptation master directory structure. This program assumes the adaptation
    master directory structure contains one directory per site. Each site
    directory contains one or more adaptation archives for that site. The
    archives can be for different dates, times, or channels. This tool may be
    used to build adaptation floppies for all sites at once (default) or to
    build individual sites (-s option). In addition, specific archive dates and
    times can be selected (-d and -t options). A single floppy will be built
    for each site that contains one archive for each channel. If multiple
    archives exist, date and time selections will be used to determine which
    adaptation archive will be selected for each channel.

Options
        -c              Clear the output directory
        -d date         Date of the adaptation data archive
			[default: today's date]
        -f              Format the floppy before copying adaptation
   			data [default: no format]
        -h              Print usage message and exit
        -i directory    Adaptation master directory
        -s              Prompt for individual site names
        -t time         Time of the adaptation data archive
			[default: 23:59:59]
        -v device       Device to mount [default: /dev/diskette]

EXAMPLES
    Build adaptation data floppies for sites KCRI and KREX. Use the latest
    archives contained within the adaptation master directory structure. As
    long as correct KCRI and KREX sub-directories exist in the
    $HOME/adapt_master directory, this example will work. For the KCRI and KREX
    sub-directories to be correct, they should include at least one adaptation
    archive file.

    Build and format adaptation floppies for all sites defined in the
    $HOME/adapt_master directory. As long as each sub-directory contained
    within $HOME/adapt_master contains at least one valid adaptation archive,
    floppies will be built for each site sub-directory. Each site floppy will
    contain adaptation archives for each node at that site. If KCRI, KREX, and
    KTLX were the sub-directories contained within the $HOME/adapt_master
    directory, floppies would be built by following this sequence:

    build_adapt_floppy -f -i $HOME/adapt_master
