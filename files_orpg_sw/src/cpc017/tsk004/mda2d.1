NAME:
	mda2d: Mesocyclone Detection Algorithm (2 dimension)  

DESCRIPTION :
	Shear segments on each elevation scan in azimuthal and radial proximity 
	combined into potential two-dimential (2D) features. Using multiple 
	strength rank thresholds, 2D vortex cores of different strength rank 
        are isolated from broader regions of 2D azimuthal shear.
	Strength rank is a function of rotational velocity, shear, and range.
	If a potential 2D feature still has enough shear segments and meets an 
	aspect ratio criticria, it is checked for overlaped with all
	previously saved 2D features on the elevation scan. If weeker features
	overlap stronger features, the weaker features are discarded.
