NAME:
        VAD Wind Profile

DESCRIPTION :
        The hplots linear buffer contains product headers for wind profile
        products. The product header has an element labeled "len".  If the value
        in len is positive it's a pointer to an entry in the product data base
        where the product is stored.  If the value is negative it's an abort
        code. The products in the data base are referenced by volume, date/time,
        and elevation cut.

        To generate necessary wind information needed by hodograph, up to 52 VAD
        derived winds have been included as tabular alphanumeric block pages. The 
	heights include RPG selected altitudes (up to 30), one per elevation at 
	constant slant range (up to 20), and low altitude supplemental winds (2).
