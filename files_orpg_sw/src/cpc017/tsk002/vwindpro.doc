This file describes the vertical wind profile algorithm.

DESCRIPTION :
        The vertical wind profile algorithm computes winds using a single
        elevation angle at a constant slant range. For each altitude requested
        the algorithm selects the elevation angle closest to intersecting that
        altitude at the vad range. The actual slant range will change dependent
        upon the altitude for which the vad wind is being calculated.
