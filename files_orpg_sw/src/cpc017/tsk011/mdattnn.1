NAME:
       mdattnn

DESCRIPTION :
        Mesocyclone Detection Algorithm (MDA) Track, Trend and Neural Network - 
           This is the portion of the MDA that attempts to track 3D features
           between volume scans.  If a feature from the current volume is 
           linked to one from the previous volume, forecast positions are
           generated by this task.
           
           Currently, the tracking logic is only used for 3D features that
           are not defined as SHALLOW.  All other features output by mda3d
           are tracked.
           
           Tracking is performed by extrapolating the position of features
           from the previous volume scan based on the average motion of up to
           ten SCIT identified storm cells with the highest cell-based VIL.
           Each 3D feature from the current volume is matched with the nearest
           feature from the last volume scan.  The task also attempts to 
           match any detected TVS features with 3D features.
	  
	   Since this is the version with the rapid update functionality, the 
	   above-mentioned tracking process is applied at the end of each 
	   elevation. At the first elevation where the new 3D features are not
	   available, the new 2D features will be matched with the closest 3D 
           couplets from the previous volume. At the second elevation and above, 
	   the new 3D couplets will be checked against the closest 3D couplets 
	   from the previous volume to prevent the features from downgrading in 
	   terms of storm severity. The unmatched features from the previous volume 
	   will be extrapolated into the current volume unless they have been 
	   lifted too much (>=3km) or at the end of the volume. 
        
	   mdattnn gets the TVS information from TDA at the end of each elevation, 
	   with the first two elevations being empty. The average storm speed and 
	   direction are read from SCIT algorithm at the end of each volume; this 
	   implies that from the first elevation through the second to last elevation 
	   mdattnn gets SCIT input from previous volume.
