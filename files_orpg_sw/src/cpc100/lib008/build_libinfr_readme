1. Untar the distribution file. The "man" subdirectory contains the man-page
files. The "include" subdirectory contains the global include files that may
need to be included in the applications that call the libinfr functions. The
"libinfr" subdirectory contains the source code.

2. To build the library and the tools, go to "libinfr", set environment "ARCH"
to lnux_x86, if on a PC/LINUX machine, and run the following:

mv make_libinfr_? Makefile
make F=-O libs - Builds the shared (dynamic) library.
make F=-O lib - Builds the static library.
make F=-O tools - Builds all tools.
make install - Installs the tools in $(HOME)/bin/$ARCH.

The libraries are created in $(HOME)/lib/$ARCH. This directory must exist.

You can use flags in building. For example

Option "F=-O" specifies the "-O" (optimization) option. You can create debug
version with "make F=-g libs". Or you can simply do "make libs".

If you want to customized the build environment, you can modify the site
dependent makefile "Make_local_lnux_x86".
