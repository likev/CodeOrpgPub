NAME
CS_int_entry - retrieve an integer-keyed entry

SYNOPSIS
#include <infr.h>
int CS_int_entry (int key, int tok, int buf_size, char *buf);

DESCRIPTION
Functions CS_int_entry and CS_name_entry are used to retrieve an entry
in terms of the "key". CS_int_entry is used for integer-keyed entry and
CS_name_entry for name-keyed entry. The two functions, if "tok" is no 
large than zero, return in "buf" the entire line following the "key" 
starting with the first token after the key and ending with the last 
character in the line excluding the line return symbol. Where by token we 
mean a consecutive character string that is separated by a space, a TAB or 
a "line return". If "tok" > 0, the "tok"-th token in the entry after the 
key is returned in "buf". The number of bytes returned in "buf" is limited 
to "buf_size" - 1. The returned character string is always NULL terminated. 
If "buf_size" is too small to hold the line or the token, the latter is 
truncated to fit the buffer size and an error number is returned. In case 
the same key is used for more than one entry, CS_int_entry and 
CS_name_entry will fail and return CS_KEY_AMBIGUOUS.

On success CS_int_entry and CS_name_entry return the length, in number of 
bytes, of the string in "buf". Otherwise they return one of the following 
negative numbers:

CS_KEY_NOT_FOUND - The key was not found in the configuration;
CS_TOK_NOT_FOUND - The "tok"-th token was not found;
CS_BUF_TOO_SMALL - The string returned was truncated;
CS_KEY_AMBIGUOUS - The key has been used for multiple entries.

CS_UNDEFINED - Environmental variable CFG_SRC was not defined and
		the configuration source is not explicitly defined
		through function CS_cfg_name;
CS_OPEN_ERR - failed in opening the configuration source (LB or file);
CS_SEEK_ERR - failed in seeking the configuration source (LB or file);
CS_READ_ERR - failed in reading the configuration text;
CS_MALLOC_ERR - malloc failed;
CS_CFG_EMPTY - No entry is found in the configuration text;
