NAME
rmt_server - Remote Execution Tool (RMT) server routines

SYNOPSIS
#include <rmt.h>
void RMT_send_log (char *msg, int beep)
void RMT_free_user_buffer (char **buf)
char *RMT_get_conf_file ()

DESCRIPTION
RMT_send_log allows the user remote procedure to write messages
to the log file. If "beep" is non-zero, the server will beep 
once.

RMT_free_user_buffer allows a remote function to pass the address of
an allocated pointer to a buffer space to the server. The allocated
space pointed by the pointer will be freed by the server upon 
completion of the remote procedure call. This feature permits 
better memory usage.

RMT_get_conf_file allows the user remote procedure to get the 
configuration file name for reading the RMT conf file.

These functions can only be called by a remote user function.
