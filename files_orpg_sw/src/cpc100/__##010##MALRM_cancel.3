NAME
MALRM_cancel - cancel a Multiple Alarm Services (MALRM) alarm

SYNOPSIS
#include <malrm.h>
int MALRM_cancel(malrm_id_t alarmid, unsigned int *remaining_secs)

DESCRIPTION
The specified MALRM alarm is cancelled.

"alarmid" is assumed to be a valid alarm ID (zero is not a valid alarm ID)
that corresponds to an alarm that is both registered and currently set.

The time remaining for the alarm is stored in the location pointed to by
"remaining_secs", unless the pointer is NULL.

Any process using the "MALRM_cancel" library routine must not trap
or otherwise interact with the signal corresponding to MALRM_ALARM_SIG.

RETURN VALUES
Zero upon success, or a negative value corresponding to one of the following
macros on failure:

MALRM_BAD_ALARMID		invalid alarm ID (e.g., '0')

MALRM_ALARM_NOT_REGISTERED	attempt to cancel an unregistered alarm

MALRM_ALARM_NOT_SET		attempt to cancel an unset alarm
