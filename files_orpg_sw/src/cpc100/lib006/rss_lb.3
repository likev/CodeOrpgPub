NAME
rss_lb - Remote System Services (RSS) Linear Buffer File (LB) routines

SYNOPSIS
#include <rss.h>
int RSS_LB_open (char *path, int flags, LB_attr *attr);
int RSS_LB_read (int lbd, char *buf, int buf_size, LB_id_t msg_id);
int RSS_LB_write (int lbd, char *msg, int length, LB_id_t msg_id);
int RSS_LB_close (int lbd);
int RSS_LB_remove (char *lb_name);
int RSS_LB_seek (int lbd, int offset, LB_id_t id, LB_id_t *new_id);
int RSS_LB_clear (int lbd, int nrm);
int RSS_LB_stat (int lbd, LB_status *status);
int RSS_LB_list (int lbd, LB_info *list, int nlist);
int RSS_LB_mark (int lbd, LB_id_t id, int mark);
int RSS_LB_size (int lbd);
LB_id_t RSS_LB_previous_msgid ();

DESCRIPTION
These functions are RPC implementation of the linear buffer functions
LB_open, LB_read, LB_write, LB_close, LB_remove, LB_seek, LB_clear,
LB_stat, LB_list, LB_mark, LB_size, and LB_previous_msgid respectively.
Their arguments and return values are the same as that of their original
counterparts except that the argument "path" in RSS_LB_open is extended
to include the host name part as described in RSS_open ().  

The user must specify "n_check" = 0 in LB_status in calling 
RSS_LB_stat if the LB is not of type LB_REAPLCE. RSS_LB_stat applies
an upper limit on "n_check". If "n_check" is too large, the function 
will fail and return an error value of RSS_TOO_MANY_CHECKS.

If rss_replace.h is included in the user's source file, the user can
directly use the original linear buffer calls, LB_open, LB_read and 
so on, and they will be automatically replaced by the corresponding 
RSS_* calls.
