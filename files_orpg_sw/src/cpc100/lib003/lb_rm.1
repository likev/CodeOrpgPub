NAME
    lb_rm - Removes LBs or messages in LBs.

SYNOPSIS
    lb_rm [-cirvh] LB_name ...

DESCRIPTION

    lb_rm is a tool that can be used for removing LBs or removing messages in 
    LBs. See Examples later on how to use this tool. Note that, lb_rm removes
    file "LB_name" if it is not an LB.

    rm is not recommended for removing LBs. lb_rm frees all resources allocated
    by the LB while rm only removes the file itself.

OPTIONS
    -c	Removes all messages in listed LBs instead of removing the LBs.

    -i	msg_id1 msg_id2 ... 
	Deletes messages of specified IDs. This works only for certain type of
	LB in which messages can be deleted randomly. Only one LB name can be
	specified.

    -r	n_messages
	Removes the oldest "n_messages" messages in each LB in the list. For 
	LBs other than those of the sequential (message queue) type, the 
	results of this are implementation dependent. In the current 
	implementation, fewer than "n_messages" messages may be deleted and
	the concept of "oldest" may not be obvious.

    -v	Verbose mode. Without this option, LB function call errors are not 
	reported.

    -h	Prints usage information.

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: lb_rm lb1 lb2
	Removes LBs named "lb1" and "lb2".

    Example 2: lb_rm /tmp/*.lb
	Removes all LBs and files with suffix ".lb" in /tmp.

    Example 3: lb_rm -c lb1 lb2
	Removes all messages in LBs "lb1" and "lb2". The LBs are still there 
	but all messages in them are discarded.

    Example 4: lb_rm -i 12 35 lb1
	Deletes messages of IDs 12 and 35 in lb1. This works only for certain
	types of LB.

    Example 5: lb_rm -r 12 lb1 lb2
	Removes 12 oldest messages in "lb1" and "lb2". If the number of 
	messages is less than 12, all messages are removed. For LBs other than 
	those of the sequential (message queue) type, the results of this is
	implementation dependent.
   
EXIT STATUS
    0:		Terminated normally. 

    non-zero:	Terminated because an error was detected.
