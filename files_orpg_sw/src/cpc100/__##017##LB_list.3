NAME
LB_list - list information about the latest messages in a Linear Buffer (LB)
		file

SYNOPSIS
#include <lb.h>
int LB_list (int lbd, LB_info *list, int nlist)

DESCRIPTION
This function returns, in "list", information about the latest 
"nlist" messages in the LB "lbd". If the number of messages in the 
LB is less than "nlist", the list length will be limited by that 
number. The list ends with the latest message. Each item in the 
array "list" is a structure containing the following members:

	LB_id_t id;		/* the message id */
	int size;		/* size of the message */
	int mark;		/* the mark value of the message */

The caller must allocate the appropriate space for the list. 

The messages returned in the list are not guaranteed to be available 
after the function call due to potential expiration.   

This function returns the length of the returned list. If no 
message is found, it returns 0. It can return one of the following 
negative numbers to indicate an error:

	LB_BAD_ARGUMENT:	One of the calling arguments does not 
				make sense or is out of range.
	LB_BAD_DESCRIPTOR:	"lbd" is not a valid LB descriptor.
	LB_INTERNAL_ERROR:	The LB is corrupted.
	LB_MALLOC_FAILED:	Failed in allocating work space.
	LB_SHMDT_FAILED:	Failed in shmdt system call.
	LB_LOCK_FAILED:		Failed in a lock system call.
	LB_MMAP_FAILED:		Failed in mmap system call.
	LB_MPROTECT_FAILED:	Failed in mprotect system call.
