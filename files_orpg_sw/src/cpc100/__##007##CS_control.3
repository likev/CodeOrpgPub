NAME
CS_control - perform Configuration Support control actions

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
#include <infr.h>
void CS_control (int action);

Function CS_control can be used to perform additional controls on the CS 
module. Its argument "action" may be a logical OR of CS_CLOSE, CS_UPDATE 
and CS_DELETE. The configuration file or LB is kept open when it is first 
accessed. Function CS_control (CS_CLOSE) can be called to close it. 
The configuration text is still available after the file or LB is closed. 
Function CS_control (CS_UPDATE) can be used to force a configuration 
update (read from the file or LB). The next CS_int_entry or CS_name_entry 
call after CS_control (CS_UPDATE) call will reread the configuration text. 
CS_control (CS_DELETE) removes the configuration text in the memory and 
frees the resource.
