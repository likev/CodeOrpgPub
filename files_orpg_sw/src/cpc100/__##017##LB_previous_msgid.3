NAME
LB_previous_msgid - return id of message returned by previous successful
			read of a Linear Buffer (LB) file

SYNOPSIS
#include <lb.h>
LB_id_t LB_previous_msgid (int lbd)

DESCRIPTION
This function returns the id of the message returned by the 
previous successful LB_read on "lbd". An LB_read call returning 
LB_BUF_TOO_SMALL is considered to be successful in this context. 

LB_previous_msgid returns LB_PREV_MSGID_FAILED (0xffffffff) if 
lbd is a bad LB descriptor or there was no previous successful 
LB_read.
