NAME
CS_cfg_name - specify an alternative configuration source

SYNOPSIS
#include <infr.h>
char *CS_cfg_name (char *name);

DESCRIPTION
Function CS_cfg_name can be used to switch to an alternative configuration 
source instead of using the default defined by the environmental 
variable CFG_SRC. If the name specified by CS_cfg_name does not have a full 
path and CFG_SRC has a full path, "name" is assumed to be in the same 
directory as the name defined by CFG_SRC. If CFG_SRC is not defined or does 
not have a full path, the current directory is assumed for "name".
CS uses a single configuration source at any time. CS_cfg_name first calls
CS_control (CS_CLOSE | CS_UPDATE), and then replaces the current 
configuration source name. CS_cfg_name ("") switches to the configuration 
source defined by CFG_SRC. CS_cfg_name (NULL) does not change the 
configuration source. CS_cfg_name returns the full configuration source 
name, which can be used for message printing purpose. Note that if CFG_SRC 
is not defined and CS_cfg_name ("") is called, CS will use "./" as the 
configuration source and fail if the configuration is used later. The 
environmental variable CFG_SRC is read every time CS_cfg_name is called.
