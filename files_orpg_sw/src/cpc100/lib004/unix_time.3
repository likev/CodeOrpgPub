NAME
unix_time() - conversion between the UNIX time and the year, month,
		day, hour, minute and second representation.

SYNOPSIS
#include <misc.h>
int unix_time (time_t *time, int *y, int *mon, int *d,
               int *h, int *m, int *s);

DESCRIPTION
unix_time converts the UNIX time in "time", if it is non-zero, to
year, month, day, hour, minute and second returned in arguments "y", 
"mon", "d", "h", "m" and "s". If "time" is assigned with value zero
before this function is called, it converts the values in "y", "mon", 
"d", "h", "m" and "s" to the UNIX time and returns it in "time".
The UNIX time is the number of seconds from 00:00:00, 01/01/1970, GMT.
The argument "y" must be at least 1970. "mon" is in the range of
1 through 12. "d" starts from 1. "h" is in the range of 0 through
23. "m" and "s" are in the range of 0 through 59.

RETURN VALUE
unix_time returns 0 on success or -1 on failure (when an argument is 
detected to be out of range).

NOTES
This function uses unsigned int internally. It works up to at least 
the end of year 2104 on 32 bit machines.

This function is implemented by using an algorithm which is efficient
in both memory and CPU usage.
