NAME
rms_tst - A test tool that allows the user to simulate commands from the
FAA/RMMS.

SYNOPSIS

        rms_tst

DESCRIPTION :

      The rms test tool allows the operator to simulate sending commands from
      the FAA/RMMS to the ORPG/RMS.  The tool is a menu driven program run
      from a separate terminal window.  It formats the command messages and
      places them directly into the ORPG/RMS input linear buffer bypassing the
      port manager. The tool will then post an event to alert the interface
      that a message is in the input buffer.

 Options: None
