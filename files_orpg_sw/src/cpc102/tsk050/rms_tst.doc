File rms_tst.doc


This file describes the RMS interface test tool.

DESCRIPTION

This tool simulates a connection with FAA/RMMS. It is a menu driven program that
formats messages and places them into the rms_input buffer.  It then posts an
event to alert the interface that a message is waiting.  This tool bypasses the
port manager by reading and writing directly to the linear buffer.  It can be
run without an RS-232 connection and will exericse the ORPG/RMS software by
forcing it to respond as if an interface were connected.  It does not read any
responses produced by the ORPG/RMS.  Another tool, rms_read_msg, is designed to
perform that function.  By using both the rms_tst and rms_read_msg tools a fully
operational FAA/RMMS can be simulated without having an actual connection.

The rms_tst tool is started in a separate terminal window from the ORPG/RMS and
communicates with the ORPG/RMS using linear buffers and event notification. The
tool is completely independant and affects the ORPG/RMS only when posting a
message to the input linear buffer.
