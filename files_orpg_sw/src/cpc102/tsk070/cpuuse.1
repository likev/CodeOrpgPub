cpuuse(1)				ORPG SUM Manpage

NAME

   cpuuse - a tool that processes script files containing the output from
   the rpg_ps tool when used with the -p option.

SYNOPSIS

   cpuuse [filename]

DESCRIPTION

   cpuuse is a non-graphical command line tool used to process script files
   resulting from using the tool rpg_ps with the flag option -p.

   With the "-p" option, rpg_ps runs as a tool for RPG performance monitoring.
   In this mode, rpg_ps prints elevation info and RPG process info every time
   a new elevation scan starts. It also prints volume info when a new
   volume starts. The RPG process info is printed in a simple raw format:
   Process name, Task ID, Instance number (-1 for single instance task),
   Process ID (-1 is not running), CPU time in milli-seconds, memory used in
   bytes and process life time in seconds. The data fields are delimited by a 
   single space.  The output file is created by the user using the Unix script
   utility, the data is then processed using cpuuse to produce a table
   summarizing each of the tasks that the rpg_ps tool reports on.  The resulting
   statistics can be used for optimizing performance and for performance         
   analysis of individual tasks.

OUTPUT

   The resulting report is written to a file titled "OUT_FILE.txt".  To prevent
   overwriting of this file prior to the next execution of the tool, the file must
   be renamed or moved to another location.
