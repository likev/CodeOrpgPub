NAME

    change_radar

    
SYNOPSIS

    change_radar [options]

    
DESCRIPTION

    The "change_radar" script changes various site adaptation data variables
    on an RPG. The modified adaptation data includes:

        site_info.rpg_name
        site_info.rpg_id
        site_info.rda_lat
        site_info.rda_lon
        site_info.rda_elev

    If the environmental variable ORPG_NONOPERATIONAL is defined, then a
    development environment is assumed. In this case, change_radar edits the
    site_info.dea file (exits with error if the file doesn't exist). If the
    environmental variable is not defined, then an operational environment is
    assumed. In this case, change_radar edits the DEAU data already in memory
    using the "edit_dea -n" command/option. Changes take effect after the next
    RPG re-start. Changes can be verified after the re-start using print_dea.


NOTE

    The "change_radar" script should only be run after the dea database has
    been initialized. This is done the first time the RPG software is started.


OPTIONS

    "change_radar" recognizes the following options:

	-h			Displays the help menu.

	-m			Runs the script in interactive mode. This
				allows the user to manually configure the site
				adaptation data settings. If this flag is
				set, all other flags (except -h and -l) are
				ignored. If -h and -l are also set, whichever
				flag is set first will be in effect.

	-l			Displays a list of supported radars. The radars
				are read from the file change_radar.dat located
				in the user's cfg (or tools/cfg) directory.
    
    	-r ICAO			Specifies the 4-letter ICAO of the radar site.
				The ICAO must be of length 4.

    	-i NUMERIC_ID		Specifies the numeric id of the radar site.
				The id must be an integer of base 10. If both
				-r and -i are set, then the -i flag is ignored.

    	-S 			Optional flag that prevents an automatic
				shutdown of the RPG software while the script is
				running. If this flag is not set, the script
				will shut down the RPG software using the
				command 'mrpg shutdown'.

    	-R 			Optional flag that prevents an automatic
				restart of the RPG software when the script is
				finished. If this flag is not set, the script
				will restart the RPG software using the command
				'mrpg startup'.

    	-d DIR			Optional flag that specifies the data directory
				containing the radar's blockage data file. If
				this flag is set, the script ensures that both
				the directory and blockage data file exist. If
				either do not, the script exits with error. If
				the script is to restart the RPG software,
				the blockage data file is copied to the user's
				cfg/bin directory. If the -R flag is set, then
				the blockage data file is copied to the user's
				data/precip directory.

			
EXAMPLES

    change_radar -l

	- Displays a list of supported radars.

    change_radar -m -l

	- Since the -m flag is first, the script will run in interactive mode.
          The -l flag is ignored.

    change_radar -i 304

	- Changes the RPG site adaptation data to the site adaptation data of
          the radar whose id is 304, if the id is supported. The RPG software
          is stopped, the adaptation data is changed, then the RPG software is
          restarted.

    change_radar -r ktlx

	- Changes the RPG site adaptation data to the site adaptation data of
          radar ktlx, if the radar is supported. The RPG software is stopped,
          the adaptation data is changed, then the RPG software is restarted.

    change_radar -r ktlx -S

	- Changes the RPG site adaptation data to the site adaptation data of
          radar ktlx, if the radar is supported. In this case, the RPG software
          is not stopped before the adaptation data is changed. The RPG software
          is automatically restarted.

    change_radar -r ktlx -S -R

	- Changes the RPG site adaptation data to the site adaptation data of
          radar ktlx, if the radar is supported. In this case, the RPG software
          is not stopped before the adaptation data is changed. In addition,
          the RPG software is not automatically restarted.

    change_radar -r ktlx -d /mnt/cdrom

	- Changes the RPG site adaptation data to the site adaptation data of
          radar ktlx, if the radar is supported. The RPG software is stopped,
          the adaptation data is changed, then the RPG software is restarted.
          Before the RPG software is restarted, the radar's blockage data file
          is copied from /mnt/cdrom to $HOME/data/precip/blockage.lb. Since
          the RPG software will be automatically started (and thus wipe out
          various linear buffers), the blockage data file is also copied to
          $HOME/cfg/bin. The RPG software will automatically copy the blockage
          data file from $HOME/cfg/bin to $HOME/data/precip at startup.
