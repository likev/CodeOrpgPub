NAME
make_rpg

SYNOPSIS
make_rpg [-h][-e] orpg_level

DESCRIPTION
This script builds the ORPG application software, interpreting the current
working directory as the base directory of the ORPG software filesystem.

"orpg_level" is typically "xpit", "swit", "beta", or "rels", corresponding
to the four current ORPG software levels.

The "make" tool is used to generate the dependency lists; clean the source
file directories of object and binary files; generate the various library
object files and then construct and install the libraries themselves (both
static and shared); generate the various binary files; and then finally
install the various executable scripts and binary files.

OPTIONS
make_rpg accepts the following options:

-e	with regard to "make", gives higher priority to environment
	variables ("make -e" is used rather than simply "make")
-h	prints a usage message
