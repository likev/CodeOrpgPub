NAME
install_tools - Uncompress the tools archive and install tool files.

SYNOPSIS
   install_tools [options]

DESCRIPTION
      This script uncompresses and untars the tools archive and places
the tools into the correct directories (i.e. data, cfg, bin, or bin/slrs_spk).
By default, this script looks for the tools archive in the current directory
with the name orpg_toolsbld*.tar.gz. Gzip compression was used so that the
archive and script could be fit on a floppy.


Options
    -h                      print usage information
    -d                      directory location of the tools archive
                            [ default: current directory ]  
    -t                      target directory
                            [ default: /export/home/vX.X ]
    -r                      remove existing tools files
                            During an install the script will generate
                            a cfg/tools_file_list file. This file is used
                            during the remove. If this file is not found an
                            error will be displayed.
    -n                      Install nbtcp tool only. Default target directory
                            of $HOME/nbtcp unless the -t option is specified.
