This file contains information about the RDA/RPG Wideband Status task.  It is
intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather
than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events
used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RDA/RPG Wideband Status task is a development and maintenance tool used to
display the current RDA/RPG wideband status and to allow the user to modify it
and write it back to the LB.  For more detailed information on using the
wb_stat command refer to the man page wb_stat(1).

The RDA/RPG Wideband Status task is a non-GUI based tool.  All input/output are
to a standard terminal window.

In interactive mode, the latest RDA/RPG wideband status is retrieved from the
RDA status message (RDA_STATUS_ID) element in the ORPGDAT_GSM_DATA LB.  The
internal data are not automatically updated upon receipt of new RDA/RPG
Wideband status data.

In commandline mode, modifications are made to the specified RDA status message
elements and written back to file.  The event ORPGEVT_RDA_STATUS_CHANGE is
posted after the data are written.

The primary purpose for this tool is to test the HCI response to various RDA/RPG
wideband status changes.

Testing
-------

It is assumed that this task will be run in an ORPG environment with the RPG
running.  If a live RDA or RDA simulator is running, updates from this tool
will be temporary as new status from the RDA or RDA simulator will overwrite
them.
