NAME
    prod_deserialize - Deserializes a given product and produces a new
                       file containing the deserialized product.

SYNOPSIS
    prod_deserialize [options] <prod_file_name>

DESCRIPTION
    The prod_deserialize tool deserializes a single product.  The tool is
    invoked at the command line, takes the product file name (and path if
    not in the current working directory), and produces an output file 
    in the same directory that contains the deserialized product.
    The output file is named the same as the input file except it has a 
    ".deser" extension.

OPTIONS
    -h        Prints usage message and exits.
    -t <file> This is the option used to specify a product attributes table file
              (product_attr_table).  If this option is not used the program
              looks in the $RPG_LEVEL/cfg directory for the product_attr_table
              file.


EXAMPLES
    prod_deserialize -h
	Prints prod_deserialize usage information.

    prod_deserialize DMD_149_E0_KCRI_07-07-2005_19:01:20Z
	Deserializes the given DMD product in the current working directory
        and produces an output file named
        "DMD_149_E0_KCRI_07-07-2005_19:01:20Z.deser" in the current
        working directory.

    prod_deserialize -t /export/home/orpg9/cfg/product_attr_table DMD_149_E0_KCRI_07-07-2005_19:01:20Z
	Deserializes the given DMD product in the current working directory
        and produces an output file named
        "DMD_141_E0_KCRI_07-07-2005_19:01:20Z.deser" in the current
        working directory.  Note that this time it uses the product_attr_table file
        located in the specified directory.
