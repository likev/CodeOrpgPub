To validate level-II files from the RPG (not NCDC):

1 - Run validate_ldm_files_ROCSWE.script or validate_ldm_files_generic.script

  A - validate_ldm_files_ROCSWE.script is for level-II data automatically collected on the ROC SWE LAN
       i   - Paths are pre-set
       ii  - Data is processed for a single day (user-defined year/month/day)
       iii - Output files are named ICAO.year.month.day.csv
       iv  - Run with -h option for more details

  B - validate_ldm_files_generic.script is for any collection of level-II data
       i   - User defines path to data
       ii  - Search is recursive (data can be in sub-directories)
       iii - Data is processed over a user defined date/time range
       iv  - Output files are named ICAO.csv
       v   - Run with -h option for more details

2 - Run validate_ldm_files_stats.script on output from #1

  A - Can process ICAOs individually and/or by region and/or by day and/or by hour
  B - Can set date/time range
  C - Can sort by time
  D - Can generate basic stats
