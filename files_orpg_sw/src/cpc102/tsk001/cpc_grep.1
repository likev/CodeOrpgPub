NAME
cpc_grep

SYNOPSIS
cpc_grep [options] pattern

DESCRIPTION

    This is a development tool to find a pattern in the ORPG source
    files.  "pattern" may be any regular expression - remember to use
    quotes to escape the shell for patterns that use shell wildcards
    (e.g. "ORPGDAT.*EV").  The script will search directories starting
    with the level specified in the RPG_LEVEL environment variable
    and print out the names of files that contain the pattern. 

OPTIONS

   -c     search C files only [default: search all source files]
   
   -f     search Fortran files only [default: search all source files]
   
   -h     print usage message and exit
      
   -l     orpg_level [default: environment variable $RPG_LEVEL]
   
   -m     search makefiles only [default: search source files]
   
   -v     verbose mode.  In addition to the file names, also print
          the source code line(s) in the files that contain the
          pattern.
   
EXAMPLE
The following searches the /xpit directory and all subdirectories for files
with the string "OTR_NEXT_VOLUME" in them, and lists the filenames.

$  setenv RPG_LEVEL xpit
$  cpc_grep -c "OTR_NEXT_VOLUME"
