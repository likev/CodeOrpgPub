This file contains information about the RDA Alarm Generation test tool.  It is
intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather
than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events
used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RDA Alarm Generation task is a development and maintenance tool used to
create and write mew RDA alarm messages to the RDA alarms data store
( ORPGDAT_RDA_ALARMS(4) ).  Its primary use is to test the HCI RDA Alarms task
response to various RDA alarm codes.  For more detailed information on using
the rda_alarm command refer to the man page rda_alarm(1).

The RDA Alarm Generation task is a non-GUI based tool.  All input/output are
to a standard terminal window.

The event ORPGEVT_RDA_ALARMS_UPDATE is posted after a new RDA alarms message is
written to ORPGDAT_RDA_ALARMS(4).

The tool can be used to generate multiple RDA alarm messages in a user specified
frequency.

Unlike RDA alarm messages generated from the RDA or RDA simulator, no system
log messages are generated by this tool; only RDA alarm messages.

Testing
-------

It is assumed that this task will be run in an ORPG environment with the RPG
running.
