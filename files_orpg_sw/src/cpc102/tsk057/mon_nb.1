NAME
    mon_nb - Prints application message information exchanged between 
             RPG and narrowband user 

SYNOPSIS
    mon_nb [options] line_index

DESCRIPTION
    mon_nb is a tool for printing information about application level (ICD) 
    messages exchanged between the RPG and narrowband user associated with 
    line index. 

    When the tool is invoked, three lines of information are immediately 
    output.  The first line provides the current date, the second line 
    informs the user which line index is being monitored followed by the 
    absolute path of the comm manager response file, and the third line 
    provides the comm manager instance number followed by the absolute path
    of the comm manager request file.  

    All lines except the date line begin with a time stamp.  The date line 
    is output when the tool is invoked and whenever the date changes.

    Outgoing messages to the narrowband user are denoted by <--- and 
    incoming message from the narrowband user are denoted by --->.  The 
    general format of messages are:
 
       Time Stamp  ---> Message Type  (Message Code x)  From ID y  To ID z

    for incoming messages or 

       Time Stamp  ---> Message Type  (Message Code x)  From ID y  To ID z

    for outgoing messages.  Examples of Message Type are PRODUCT REQUEST, 
    ALERT MESSAGE, and GENERAL STATUS MESSAGE.  The Message Code for the 
    various message types is defined in the Associated PUP/RPG ICD.  The From 
    ID is the ID of the RPG or PUP from which the message originated, the To 
    ID is the ID of the RPG or PUP to which the message is being sent.  The To
    ID is not guaranteed to always be defined.  An undefined ID is denoted as 
    0000.

    Following the message type line are the message content lines. With the 
    exception of the Message Type PRODUCT message, the tool outputs, in plain 
    language, the entire message content as defined in the Associated PUP/RPG 
    or the Non- Associated PUP/RPG ICDs.

    The PRODUCT message describes a product sent to the narrowband user.  The 
    product code, sequence number, volume scan number, volume scan date/time and
    product dependent parameters are given.  A sequence number of -13 indicates
    an alert paired product.  Products with size greater than 10K (10240 bytes)
    are segmented into 10K blocks.  For each 10K block (other than the first), a
    "Continuing Message" message is written.   

OPTIONS
    -h	prints usage message and exits.
