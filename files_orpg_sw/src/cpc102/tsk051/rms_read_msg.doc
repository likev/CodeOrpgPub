This file describes the RMS interface read message tool.

DESCRIPTION
The read message routine allows the operator to read outgoing ORPG/RMS messages
in a useful format.  The messages are sent as streams of 7-bit unsigned bytes.
 When the ORPG/RMS
places a message in the output linear buffer it posts an event to notify the
port manager a message is waiting to be sent.  The read message routine receives
this event and reads the message also. The message is then decoded, and printed
out for the user to read.  Read message does not interfere with the interface
and is ignored by the ORPG/RMS and the FAA/RMMS. The read message program is run
from a separate terminal window than the ORPG.

The read message program can also simulate an FAA/RMMS connection. When the
process is first started the operator will be asked whether or not they want
acknowledgement messages sent.  If the user selects yes, the read message
program will return an acknowledgement message for every ORPG/RMS message it
reads. This will simulate a connection to an FAA/RMMS and will keep the ORPG/RMS
from shutting the interface down and starting an rms up message.
