This file contains information about the RPG X Product Display Tool (XPDT)
task.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is
designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data
stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The XPDT task is a development and maintenance tool used to display RPG
products.  The products can be displayed directly from a simple file or
indirectly from the RPG products database.  For more detailed information on
using the xpdt command refer to the man page xpdt(1).

The design of the XPDT task is relatively simple.  Since the main purpose of
its use is to allow a developer or maintainer to display RPG generated products,
very few options are provided.

The window can be resized.

Map files use the USGS digital line graph data format.  The environment
variable XPDT_MAP_FILE defines the path and filename containing the map data.
A map file does not have to be defined.

If products are to be read from the RPG products database, the environmental
variable ORPG_PRODUCTS_DATABASE must be defined.  The full pathname and
filename must be supplied.

Multilayered product types are not supported at this time.  If one is selected
then the task exits.  An improvement to this task would be not to terminate the
program when an unsupported product is selected.

The product and time lists can support a maximum of 4000 items.

The selected product file can contain up to 32000 products.

Testing
-------

It is assumed that this task will be run in an ORPG environment with the RPG
running if products are to be retrieved from the RPG products database.
