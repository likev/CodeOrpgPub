NAME
    mon_wb - Prints information about application messages exchanged between 
             the RDA and the RPG.

SYNOPSIS
    mon_wb [options]

DESCRIPTION
    mon_wb is a tool for printing information about application level (ICD) 
    messages exchanged between the RDA and RPG.

    When the tool is invoked, a number of lines are immediately output.
    The first non-blank line provides the current date.  The second
    non-blank line contains the direction of the RPG to RDA communications and
    the absolute path of the comm manager request file.  The third non-blank
    line provides direction of the RDA to RPG communications and the absolute
    path of the comm manager response file.  To allow for easier reading, 
    dividers consisting of strings of equal signs are provided to separate
    messages.  The first line of each individual message feedback will contain
    the message time, direction of communication, and some textual description
    of the message.  Other important information regarding that message will
    follow.  For example, in the sample output provided below this paragraph,
    the message range checking function detected the "data_trans_enbld" field
    as containing an out of range value compared to the specifications in the
    ICD.  An alert message is provided along with the value.  For some fields,
    the valid range will also be provided.

    The communication is RPG-centric.  Outgoing messages to the RDA are denoted
    by ---> and incoming message from the RDA are denoted by <---.

    Sample output:

       05/20/03
           
       RPG ---> RDA Request LB : /export/home/orpg4/data/comms/req.0
       RPG <--- RDA Response LB: /export/home/orpg4/data/ingest/resp.0
       =========================================================================
       17:24:57  ---> RDA CONTROL COMMANDS MSG (Msg Type: 6)
       =========================================================================
       17:24:57  <--- RDA STATUS MSG (Msg ID:30198 Type:2 Len:132 Req Num:30170)
          
               !!!! ALERT !!!! : DEAU: Range check failed (value 28.000000):
               RDA_status_msg_t.data_trans_enbld
               
       =========================================================================


   Verbosity Levels:

       The "-v" option can be used followed by a positive integer.  The 
       following text briefly describes the output for each verbosity level.
       Note that important information such as data out-of-range alerts,
       message types, message direction, and message separators are printed
       always, regardless of the verbosity level.

       Verbose Level 0  - The default level (same as running with no -v option).
                         
       Verbose Level 1  - The most commonly used verbosity level.  Items printed
                          for V0 are printed plus formatted prints of the
                          structure's most important fields.

       Verbose Level 2  - Items printed for V1 plus formatted prints of all
                          structure fields.

       Verbose Level 3  - Items printed for V2 plus formatted prints of the
                          message headers.

       Verbose Level 4  - Items printed for V3 plus formatted prints of the
                          communications headers and diagnostic information (the
                          status of processing).

       Verbose Level 5+ - Items printed for V4 plus testing prints used for
                          development and debugging.


OPTIONS
    -a        Validates all messages, including intermediate basedata messages
    -h        Prints usage message and exits.
    -v<level> Verbose mode. A positive integer must follow "-v".  Typical values are
              1-4, with larger numbers indicating more verbosity.
    -r<buf>   Rewinds the user-specified buffer.  Options for "buf" are I = Input
              Buffer (typically the response LB), O = Output Buffer (typically
              the request LB), and B = Both the Input and Output Buffers.
    -f<I/O><file> This is the "file" option.  It allows users to specify an
              input (I) or output (O) LB of their own they would like to process.
              No space is allowed after the I or O and before the file path/name.


EXAMPLES
    mon_wb -h
	Prints mon_wb usage information.

    mon_wb -v3 -a
	Level three verbosity, process all messages including intermediate (not
        start/end of elevation/volume) basedata messages.

    mon_wb -v1 
	Level one verbosity.

    mon_wb -rB -v2 
	Rewind both the Input and Output LBs, use level two verbosity.

    mon_wb -rI -v3 -fI/export/home/orpg1/my_input.lb
        Rewind the Input LB which is user-specified.  Use level two verbosity.
