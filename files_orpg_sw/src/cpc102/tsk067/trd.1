NAME

trd - the ORPG Terrain/Blockage display tool

SYNOPSIS

trd

DESCRIPTION

This tool is used to display the terrain and blockage data graphically.
The terrain and blockage data exist in radial format with an azimuth interval 
of 0.1 degree and range interval of 1 kilometer out to 230 kilometers.  

By default, terrain data are displayed at startup.  The data display range
is automatically adjusted to the min/max values found in the file.  The user
has the option to change the display range by selecting the "Display Range"
button and adjusting the values in the Data Range window.  Blockage data are
displayed in the range 0 to 100% by default.  This range can also be adjusted
in the Data Range window.

Blockage data exist at all levels starting at -1.0 degree elevation up to the
first level where no blockage is detected, in 0.1 degree intervals.  A combo
box widget is defined containing all levels.  It the Blockage type is selected,
then any one of these levels can be selected from the Blockage Level menu.

A vertical profile of the data along any selected radial is displayed in the
area below the menu buttons.  A new radial can be selected in "Raw" mode by
selecting a location on the terrain or blockage display.  A blinking line is
displayed along the selected radial.

OPTIONS

	-p	Defines the path to the blockage and terrain LBs.  If specified,
		the path must be a quoted string, e.g.,

			trd -d "/export/home/orpg/data/precip"

		If the path is not specified and the environmental variable 
		ORPGDIR is defined, the files are assumed to reside in
		$(ORPGDIR)/precip/ directory.  If ORPGDIR is not defined, 
		then the files are assumed to reside in the current directory.
