NAME

   acc1 - the RPG elevation/volume scan accounting tool

SYNOPSIS

   acc1 

DESCRIPTION

   acc1 is a non-graphical interactive tool used to display elevation and/or 
   volume scan accounting information.  This information is compiled and 
   published by the Process Base Data process (pbd).

   The tool consists of a hierarchical menu system.  Each menu consists of 
   option(s) of which Exit (0) is always an option.  To leave a window to
   go to the parent window, select Exit.   Selecting Exit at the parent window
   terminates the tool.

   Options exits for selecting elevation and/or volume accounting data.  For 
   volume accounting, the user has the option of displaying a single volume 
   scan, multiple volume scans in a range of volume scans, or all currently 
   defined volume scans.  Volume scans are defined in terms of volume scan
   sequence number.

   The volume scan accounting data lists general information such as VCP number,
   weather mode, Doppler resolution, overlay margin, and calibration constant.
   For each elevation cut, the elevation cut number, the start and end times, 
   the start and end azimuth angles, the angle of the pseudo end of elevation,
   the elevation angle, and the number of radials are provided. 
  
   For elevation accounting, only a single volume scan can be selected.  The 
   volume scan is selected via volume scan sequence number.   The elevation
   scan accounting data lists general information such as VCP number, weather
   mode, Doppler resolution, overlay margin, and calibration constant.  In 
   addition, for each elevation cut number, the starting azimuth angle, Nyquist
   velocity, and unambiguous range are provided for the three PRF sectors.
   The atmospheric attenuation constant is also listed for each elevation.
