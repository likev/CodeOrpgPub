This file contains information about the RDA Status Message task.  It is
intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather
than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events
used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RDA Status Message task is a development and maintenance tool used to
display the contents of the latest RDA Status message and to allow the user
to modify its contents and write it back to the LB.  For more detailed
information on using the rdastat command refer to the man page rdastat(1).

The RDA Status Message task is a non-GUI based tool.  All input/output are
to a standard terminal window.

In interactive mode, the latest RDA status message (RDA_STATUS_ID) is first
read from the ORPGDAT_GSM_DATA(4) LB.  The internal data are not automatically
updated upon receipt of new RDA status data.  A selection is provided for the
user to manually update the internal data if desired.

In commandline mode, modifications are made to the specified RDA status message
elements and written back to file.  The event ORPGEVT_RDA_STATUS_CHANGE is
posted after the data are written.

The primary purpose for this tool is to test the HCI response to various RDA
status changes.

Testing
-------

It is assumed that this task will be run in an ORPG environment with the RPG
running.  If a live RDA or RDA simulator is running, updates from this tool
will be temporary as new status from the RDA or RDA simulator will overwrite
them.
