NAME
build_install_files

SYNOPSIS
build_install_files [options] -t thread_name -v thread_version

DESCRIPTION
This script builds the tape archive ("tar") ORPG software installation file
either in the current working directory or in the directory specified by the
"-d workdir" option.

For a given thread and version, this script first constructs a Project Thread
Version File using the appropriate SCCS "s." file retrieved from the Razor
archive.  The script exits with an error message and a return value of 1 if it
is unable to retrieve the SCCS file.  The build configuration file is
placed in the file ./cfg subdirectory.  The name of the file
reflects the specified thread name and version (e.g., bld_mb1_swit_v1.16 for
version 1.16 of the mb_swit thread).

The script ensures that the shared libraries have access modes of octal
555 (read and execute for owner, group, and the world).  The script is
currently aware of the "hpux_rsk", "lnux_x86", "slrs_spk", and "slrs_x86"
architectures.  These shared libraries are located in ./lib/hpux_rsk,
./lib/lnux_x86, ./lib/slrs_spk, and ./lib/slrs_x86.

Several checksum files are created by the script.  The created filenames
and the corresponding input files are listed below:

./cfg/data_cksum		./data/*
./cfg/bin_hpux_rsk_cksum	./bin/hpux_rsk/*
./cfg/bin_lnux_x86_cksum	./bin/lnux_x86/*
./cfg/bin_slrs_spk_cksum	./bin/slrs_spk/*
./cfg/bin_slrs_x86_cksum	./bin/slrs_x86/*
./cfg/lib_hpux_rsk_cksum	./lib/hpux_rsk/*.sl
./cfg/lib_lnux_x86_cksum	./lib/lnux_x86/*.so
./cfg/lib_slrs_spk_cksum	./lib/slrs_spk/*.so
./cfg/lib_slrs_x86_cksum	./lib/slrs_x86/*.so

Note that the checksums of the static libraries are not calculated, as these
libraries are not placed in the installation file.  These checksum files are
provided for field software quality assurance.

Although not part of the ORPG software configuration management filesystem, 
empty ./logs and ./tmp subdirectories are created by the script to ensure that
these subdirectories care created upon installation of the ORPG software in
the field.

Finally, the script generates the installation file by archiving the following
files into a tape archive file named "orpg_[threadname]_v{threadversion].tar"
(e.g., orpg_mb1_swit_v1.16.tar):

./.bashrc		Bash non-login environment file
./.bash_profile		Bash login environment file
./.cshrc		C Shell run commands file
./.dtprofile		CDE DeskTop profile file
./.dt			CDE DeskTop files
./.rssd.conf		RSSD configuration file
./bin			ORPG script and binary executable files
./bitmaps		Bitmap images
./cfg			ORPG configuration files
./data			ORPG static data files
./install_rpg		ORPG development system installation script
./lib/lnux_x86/*.so	ORPG Linux x86 shared library files
./lib/slrs_spk/*.so	ORPG Solaris Sparc shared library files
./logs			ORPG log files (empty)
./man			ORPG POSIX manpage files
./orda			ORDA files
./tmp			ORPG temporary files (empty)

OPTIONS
build_install_files accepts the following options:

-d workdir 	use the specified working directory [default: current
			working directory]
-h		print usage message

EXAMPLES
The following illustrates building the installation file for version 1.16 of
the "mb1_swit" thread using the files in /swit:

% build_install_files -d /swit -t mb1_swit -v 1.16
