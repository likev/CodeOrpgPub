NAME
    play_a2
    
SYNOPSIS
    play_a2 [options]
    
DESCRIPTION

    "play_a2" performs the following functions:

	a. Reads WSR-88D Level II archive data from compressed (bzip2 or
	compress) files on disk (or CD) and ingests the data into the ORPG. 

	b. Reads WSR-88D Level II archive tape and ingests the data into the 
	ORPG. 

	c. Reads WSR-88D Level II archive tape and creates compressed volume 
	files that can be read by this tool for playback (function a).

	d. Writes selected volume files to writable and re-writable CD.

    In playback mode, the default behavior is to write the data in real-time to
    the ORPG radial data input data store. Radial data messages as well as all
    ICD RDA messages are passed to the ORPG. If a start-of-volume radial status
    is found in the middle of a volume, the radial status flag is reset to
    start-of-elevation. The -o option can be used to specify an alternative
    playback data store.

    "play_a2" is an interactive tool using text-based menus. When the tool
    waits for an input, one can type ctrl-c to cancel the current selection and
    return to the menu. "play_a2" also supports command line mode operation
    when used for playing back volume files.

    To start the tool in interactive mode, one can do the following:

	Set the environment variable A2_OPTIONS (See later) and type
	"play_a2". This will start play_a2 in volume file playback mode. No
	options can be specified in this case. Any option except -i and -a will
	start "play_a2" in non-interactive mode.

	Type "play_a2 -i". This will start play_a2 in volume file playback
	mode. The -i option allows the user to use additional options, such as
	-x and -d.

	Type "play_a2 -a". This will start play_a2 in tape playback mode.
	Additional options, such as -x, can be supplied.

    In the interactive mode, one can switch from file playback mode to tape
    playback mode and vice versa by going to the "Options" sub-menu. To write
    to CD, one needs also to go to the "Options" sub-menu.

    The volume file name must be in one of the following forms:

	prefix_yyyy?mm?dd?hh?mm?ss*Suffix
	prefixyyyymmdd_hhmmssSuffix
	prefix_yyyymmdd?hhmmss*Suffix

    where "prefix" is the first part (often used for the radar label). "prefix"
    must not contain character "_". "yyyy", the first "mm", "dd", "hh", the
    second "mm' and "ss" are respectively the year, month, day, hour, minute
    and second of the volume time. "?" can be any non-digit character and "*"
    can be any string. The first character of "*" must not be a digit. "Suffix"
    can be either ".bz2" or ".Z" which indicates the compression type.

    The data directory is specified by the -d option and/or the environmental
    variable AR2_DIR. Denote the -d option, the AR2_DIR and the present working
    directory by respectively "Odir", "Edir" and "Pwd". The data directory is
    determined by the following rules:

	If "Odir" exists and it is a complete path, it is used as the DD (data
	directory). Otherwise if "Edir" exists, "Edir" is inserted in front of
	"Odir" ("" is used if "Odir" is not specified) to form the DD. If the
	path is still not complete, "Pwd" is inserted in front of it to
	complete the path. A string of single character "." or a string
	starting with "./" is accepted and treated as the present working
	directory.

    In the interactive mode, one can select a new data directory from the file
    playback mode's main menu.

    In the file playback mode, "play_a2" generates a list of all files, that
    conform to the volume file naming convention, by searching the data
    directory and its subdirectories of up to 3 levels. Identical files are not
    taken. The files are sorted based on first the prefix (radar label) and
    then the volume time for files of the same prefix. Files then are selected
    from this list for playback or written to CD.

    In the interactive file playback mode, all volume files are organized into
    data sessions based on that the time gap between two consecutive volumes
    are not larger than a specified time (with default of 15 minutes). Then one
    can select a session to playback. Following the menu, one can do the
    following: Select a new data directory; Select a radar data session, the
    first volume and the number of volumes to playback; Set the playback speed;
    Set the repeated playback mode; Choose a pause mode; Select a maximum
    volume time gap which is used to identify the sessions. While the playback
    is in progress, one can stop (pause) the playback. While it is stopped, one
    can choose to either continue or abort the current playback session. One
    can choose to initiate (with ctrl-c) the pause at the end of the current
    radial, the current elevation or the current volume.

    After a session is selected, one can specify a volume in the session to
    start with. In responding to "Enter start vol time (yy:mm:dd:hh:mn or
    hh:mn) or index (1 to 2) and, optionally (separated by space), # volumes:",
    the following inputs, for example, are all acceptable:

	1994:10:16:02:27
	02:27
	3
	1994:10:16:02:27 4
	02:27 4
	3 4

    The first three specify only the starting volume. The number of volumes to
    play is all available volumes. The second line specifies the hour and
    minute of the starting volume. This format works for specifying a time that
    is within 24 hours of the session start time. The third line specifies the
    volume index of the first playback volume. The index of the first volume in
    the session is 1. The lines 4 through 6 are the same as the first three
    lines except that the number of the volumes to playback is specified. The
    number will be adjusted to fit to the available volume files in the
    session.

    In the tape playback mode, by following the menu, one can do the following:
    Rewind the tape; Start playback at current tape position; Search to a
    specific volume and start to playback; Advance the tape to skip forward a
    number of volumes; Sets playback speed; Select save volume mode. 

    To change the tape in the drive without terminating play_a2: 1. Select "Go
    to volume file playback mode" in the "Options" menu. 2. Change the tape and
    wait until the drive settles sown. 3. Select "Go to tape playback mode" in
    the "Options" menu.

    When responding to "Enter: start time (yy:mm:dd:hh:mn or hh:mn) or volume
    #:", one can choose to enter in one of the three ways: A long time format
    starting with year, a short time format of only hour and minute or a volume
    number.

    In the tape playback mode, one can select the save volume mode (from the
    "Option" menu). In this mode the data read from tape are used to generate
    volume files instead of being sent to the ORPG. Volume files are generated
    on the working directory defined by environment variable "WORK_DIR". If
    "WORK_DIR" is not defined, "/tmp" is used. One can also enter an
    alternative directory by selecting "Select a new dir to save volume" in the
    "Options" menu. Volume files generated use the volume file naming
    convention and are compressed with bzip2. These files can be played by this
    tool or saved on CD. If the tool cannot figure out the radar label, the
    user has to enter the radar label (one of the selections in the "options"
    menu).

    Volume files read in the file playback mode or read from the tape in tape
    playback mode can be written to a CD. This selection is in the "Options"
    menu. In CD write mode, volume files are organized into sessions (the
    maximum time gap between consecutive volumes are 15 minutes). One then
    selects sessions that are to be written to the CD. One can use the "Select
    session" and "Deselect session" to select the desired sessions. After
    sessions are selected, one can select "Write CD" to start writing CD.

    "play_a2" supports non-interactive volume file playback. In this mode, the
    volume files to playback can be specified with two different options: The
    command line option and the play list option.

    The command line option uses the following "play_a2" options to specify
    the files to playback. -d is used to specify the data directory as
    described earlier. -r is used to select a "prefix" (e.g. radar). -s is used
    to specify the first volume to start with (and the prefix as well). -n is
    used to specify the number of volumes to playback. The playback is
    performed sequentially in terms of the sorted volume list (described
    earlier). If -s option is not specified, the first volume for the selected
    radar is used. If the -r option is not specified, volumes from all radars
    are selected. In the latter case, the playback will go through all volumes
    of a radar and then continue to the next radar.

    The play list option (-p option) allows one to use a file to list all
    volume files to playback. In this option volume files will be read in the
    listed order and do not need to follow a standard naming convention.
    Options -s and -r are ignored. In the file, each line specifies a volume
    file name. The first line can, by option, specify a directory where the
    data files are located. This directory is used as if it comes from the -d
    option and the -d option, if specified, is ignored. If the directory is not
    specified, the directory is determined in the normal way: -d option,
    AR2_DIR and/or pwd. Empty lines are allowed. Leading and trailing spaces
    and tabs are allowed. All file names without a complete path are assumed to
    be in the data directory. A sample play list file is given later in this
    man-page.

    Options -x can be used to control the playback speed. The speed is
    specified as a multiple of the real time data rate. For example, .5 means
    half of the read time speed and 2 means a speed of twice of the real
    time. This option can be used for all modes: interactive, non-interactive
    and tape playback. The playback speed only applies to data within a volume
    scan by default. If option "-T" is selected, the playback speed applies to
    each entire playback session (The time gaps between volumes are simulated).
    The playback speed is limited by how fast the data can be read from the
    storage and decompressed and, thus, may be slower than specified.


    Option -c can be used to set the repeated playback mode. The "-t" option
    directs "play_a2" to only print the file names that would be played back
    instead of performing the playback. These two options are used only for
    non-interactive mode.

    Options -r, -s, -c, -n, -t, -q and -p are ignored in interactive mode. 

    "play_a2" invokes "mkisofs" to create a file system and "cdrecord" to write
    the CD. Before one can write CD, one needs to find out the local device ID
    (something looks like 1,5,0) of the CD drive. This can be done by running
    "cdrecord -scanbus". One needs also to find out the appropriate writing
    speed. One can optionally (See the next paragraph), let "play_a2" convert
    all files, that are compressed with "compress", to be compressed with bzip2
    before writing to CD.

    "play_a2" uses environmental variable "A2_OPTIONS" for specifying the CD
    device ID and certain options. The format of this environmental variable is
    "KEY=value;KEY=value;...". Each field is specified with a KEY and a VALUE.
    Fields are separated by ";" or ":". Accepted keys are CDW_DEVICE,
    CDW_SPEED, TAPE_DEVICE and CONVERT_TO_BZ2. They are used for specifying
    respectively the CD devise ID, the CD writing speed, the tape device and
    whether converting to the bzip2 format before CD writing. CONVERT_TO_BZ2
    does not require a value. CDW_DEVICE is required and others are optional
    with default values of TAPE_DEVICE="/dev/rmt/0mb", CDW_SPEED=4 and
    CONVERT_TO_BZ2 not defined. An example is

	"TAPE_DEVICE=/dev/rmt/0mb;CDW_DEVICE=1,5,0;CDW_SPEED=8;CONVERT_TO_BZ2"

    "play_a2" also uses the working directory (described earlier) for storing
    temporary files when writing CD and playing back certain data formats.

    "play_a2" may create a file, called play_a2.log, in the working directory
    for logging status and error messages. Specifically, in the writing CD
    procedure, all outputs from "cdrecord" and "mkisofs" go to that file. One
    can, by reading the file, find out why, for example, CD writing failed.
