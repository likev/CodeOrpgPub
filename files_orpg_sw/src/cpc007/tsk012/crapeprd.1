NAME
cpc007 tsk012 crapeprd - Composite Reflectivity AP-Edited Cartesian Grid

INPUTS
	CRPGAPE - VOLUME_DATA
	COMBATTR - VOLUME_DATA (optional; block_time: 5 seconds)

OUTPUTS
	CRPAPE95 - VOLUME_DATA, 95
	CRPAPE96 - VOLUME_DATA, 96
	CRPAPE97 - VOLUME_DATA, 97
	CRPAPE98 - VOLUME_DATA, 98

BASE
	VOLUME_BASED

DESCRIPTION
	This task generates four AP-Edited Composite Reflectivity products 
	in the same format as the existing CR products (product message 
	codes 35 - 38).   These new products have the mnemonic CRE and use
	product message codes 95 - 98.  Since the format of the input to
	this task is the same as the CMPRFCG task, most of the CMPRFCG 
	modules are shared with this task.  A new main module (crapeprd) 
	and buffer control module (A307C1) were written for this task and
	the following software modules are shared with the CMPRFCG task:
	A30740, A30744, A30745, A30746, A30748, A30749, A3074A.  It also
	uses the following common modules: A3CM22, A3CM25, A3CM29, A3CM36,
	A3CM37.  A new module, A307C2 was written to shift product message
	codes from 35-38 to 95-98. In addition this task includes elements:
	A307P4, A307D4, A307P9, and A307D9 from A307BUF.INC.  From
	A309ADPT.INC this task includes elements A3CD70C5, A3CD70C8,
	and A3CD70CA to register adaptation data COLRTABL, RDACNT,
	and SITEADP, respectively.
