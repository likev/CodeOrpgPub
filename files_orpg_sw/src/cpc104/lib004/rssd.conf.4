NAME
    .rssd.conf - rssd configuration file.

DESCRIPTION
    .rssd.conf is the rssd configuration file. The file specifies the 
    permission information on remote hosts that can use the rssd services and 
    local files that can be accessed through the local rssd.

    .rssd.conf is line based. A line started with word "Client:" followed by a
    host name or an IP address defines a remote host that is permitted to use
    the rssd's RPC service. Wild card "*" can be used in one of the IP address
    fields. All listed hosts, excluding the ones with wild card "*", form the
    domain for the rssd's event notification service. All hosts participating
    in the event notification service should have the same "Client:" list
    (identical hosts in the same order) in their .rssd.conf files.

    A line started with word "Path:" followed by a path string defines a file
    that can be accessed through rssd's RPC service. If "path" is a directory,
    all files in it and its sub-directories are accessible.

EXAMPLES
    An example .rssd.conf file can be found in the RPG software distribution.
