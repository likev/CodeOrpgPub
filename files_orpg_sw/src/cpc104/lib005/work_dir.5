WORK_DIR(5)         RPG Environment Variable Manpage         WORK_DIR(5)

NAME
WORK_DIR - defines RPG working directory pathname

DESCRIPTION
The WORK_DIR environment variable defines the RPG working directory pathname.

This environment variable is NOT set in the fielded software.  Instead,
the default pathname $HOME/tmp is used.

Some infrastructure software references this environment variable (i.e.,
it is not RPG-specific, which is why the variable name is generic).

Task-private files and/or datastores should reside in the directory
identified by the WORK_DIR environment variable.

Maintenance tasks will be used to maintain these files.  If a task needs
well-defined handling of its private files that reside in the directory
identified by WORK_DIR, the task developer must provide a custom maintenance
task that will be invoked by Manage RPG during control of the RPG.
