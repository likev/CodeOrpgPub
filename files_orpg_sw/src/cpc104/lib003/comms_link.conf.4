NAME
    comms_link.conf - WAN comms link configuration file

DESCRIPTION
    comms_link.conf is the file defining all RPG WAN communication links. It is
    used by mrpg, comm_manager, p_server and other RPG tasks. This file must be
    in the CS format.

    The first part of the file is a table of all configured comms links. Each
    row specifies a link. The columns are:

	link number (0, 1, ...) - Link numbers must be contiguous and start with
		0.

	comm_user number (0, 1, ...) - The instance specification of the 
		application that uses the link.

	comm_manager number (0, 1, ...) - The instance number of the 
		comm_manager that manage the link.

	physical device number (0, 1, ...) - The device number of the link.

	physical port number (0, 1, ...) - The port number of the link.

	link type - Type of the link: Dedic (for dedicated link), D-in (for 
		dial-in link) or D-out (for dial in/out link);

	line rate - Nominal baud rate of the link. e.g. 56000. 0 means using 
		external clock;

	comm_manager name - Name of the comm_manager that manage this link. 
		e.g. cm_simpact, cm_uconx, cm_sisco, cm_tcp, cm_atlas. 

	maximum packet size - packet size in number of bytes. It must be >= 32.

	number of PVC stations on the link - 0 indicates the HDLC protocol.

	link state - 0 (for enabled) or 1 (for disabled).

	Incoming data event notification - 1 (for enabled. i.e. event is posted
		when incoming WAN data is available) or 0 (for disabled).

    Some of the fields are used only by some of the comm_managers. Even if a 
    field is not used, a valid token (a number or a work) must be specified 
    (i.e. an empty field is not allowed).

    The total number of configured links must be specified with key 
    "number_links".

    The link used for "wide band", i.e. the RDA connection, must be specified
    with key word "RDA_link".

    The second part of the file contains comm_manager specific info:

	SIMPACT_CS_config_file - specifies the cs config file for SIMPACT.

	SIMPACT_X25_config_files - specifies the x25 config files, one for each
		device, for SIMPACT.

	SIMPACT_server_addresses - specifies the IP address of each SIMPACT 
		comms server.

	UCONX_config_file - specifies the UCONX comms configuration file.

	UCONX_server_addresses - specifies the IP address of each UCONX 
		comms server.

	TCP_config_file - specifies the configuration file for TCP links.

	CISCO_config_file - specifies the CISCO comms configuration file.

    distribution.
