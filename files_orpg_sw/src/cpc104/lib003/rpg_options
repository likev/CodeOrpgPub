# RPG Options
#
# Purpose: This file contains options which can be invoked from the
#	   RPG HCI when the RPG is in defined states.  Typically, it
#	   contains selections to reinitialize various RPG components
#	   when the RPG is shutdown.  However, this can be extended
#	   to other RPG states as well.
#
# Notes:   This file can be edited while the RPG is operating.  The
#	   RPG doesn't need to be restarted.

#
# This file contains a set of special tasks which can be invoked through
# the HCI under controlled conditions.  A set of rules has been defined
# so that the HCI can dynamically build a set of objects for the user to
# select from.  A sample task entry is defined below.
#
# 	Task {
#		name 		"Cleanup logs"
#		description	"This option removes all log files"
#		action		"/bin/sh -c (remove_logs -c)"
#		state		MRPG_ST_SHUTDOWN
#		permission	"URC"
#		group		"State Data"
#		msg		"This message goes to syslog file"
#	}
#
# In the above example, a toggle button with the label "Cleanup logs"
# would be added to the HCI window in a frame named "State Data".  It
# would only be selectable when the RPG is in a shutdown state and the
# user has unlocked the URC password. If the RPG was in a shutdown
# state and the item was selected, then the action performed would
# be to invoke the "remove_logs -c" command using the "system()" function.
#
# The valid state fields are defined in the header file mrpg.h.
# Multiple states are supported.  Each field must be separated by one
# or more blanks.  For example, if one wanted an option to be available
# in both shutdown and operate states, the following state entry could
# be defined:
#
#	state	MRPG_ST_SHUTDOWN MRPG_ST_OPERATING
#
# The valid permission fields are "ROC", "URC", and "NONE". If a permission
# is not specified, it will take the permission value of the preceding entry.
#
# Multiple actions can be invoked by separating each command by the
# ";" character.  For example, if the user wanted to invoke "task1"
# "task2 -c -f", and "task3 100" from a single selection they could
# define the following action entry:
#
#	action	"/bin/sh -c (task1;task2 -c -f;task3 100)"
#
# Refer to the HCI header file "hci_rpg_options.h" for specific
# limits on the number of init options entries allowed and the maximum
# lengths for the description, action, state, and msg strings.
