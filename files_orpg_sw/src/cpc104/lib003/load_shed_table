# BEGIN Load Shed Threshold Table
#
# Each load shed threshold entry is defined by a set of attributes who's
# values are identified by a set of predefined keys.  A load shed category
# entry is identified by the keyword "Category" with all attributes contained
# within a set of brackets "{}".  The attributes are defined as follows:
#
#	name <string>
#		where <string> is an up to 16 character ASCII string
#		describing the name of the entry.
#
#	warn <num>
#		where <num> is a number in the range 0 to 100 representing
#		the threshold percentage at which a warning is generated.
#
#	alarm <num>
#		where <num> is a number in the range 0 to 100 representing
#		the threshold percentage at which an alarm is generated.
#

#	refer to load_shed_threshold_t in orpglsc.h
