rpg_options.doc                 NOTES        rpg_options.doc

This file contains information about the RPG Options configuration file.  It is
intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather
than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events
used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RPG Options configuration file was designed to be very simple yet flexible
enough for the user to add additional task entries.  Each task entry begins
with the "Task {" key and must be terminated with a "}".  The name, description,
action, state, and msg keys must be defined.  Currently, the HCI RPG Options
menu doesn't use the description string but it should be defined in any event.

Notes:   This file can be edited while the RPG is operating.  The  RPG doesn't
need to be restarted.

Refer to the man page rpg_options(4) for more information.
