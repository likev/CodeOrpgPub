1. Untar the distribution file. The "man" subdirectory contains the man-page
files. The "include" subdirectory contains the global include files that may
need to be included in the applications that call the libinfr functions. The
"libinfr" subdirectory contains the source code for libinfr and its tools. The
"cm_tcp" subdirectory contains the source code for cm_tcp.

2. To build the library and the tools, cd to "libinfr", set environment variable 
"ARCH" to lnux_x86 and run the following: 

cp make_libinfr_m Makefile 
make F=-O libs - Builds the shared (dynamic) library.
make F=-O lib - Builds the static library.
make F=-O tools - Builds all tools.
make install - Installs the tools in $HOME/bin/$ARCH. This directory must 
exist.

The libraries are created in $HOME/lib/$ARCH. This directory must exist.

You can use compiler flags in building. For example

Option "F=-O" specifies the "-O" (optimization) option. You can create debug
version with "make F=-g libs". Or you can simply do "make libs".

If you want to customized the build environment, e.g. you want to use cc
instead of gcc, you can modify the site dependent makefile
"Make_local_lnux_x86".

3. To build the library and the tools, go to "cm_tcp", set environment "ARCH"
to lnux_x86 and run the following:

cp make_cm_tcp Makefile
make F=-O  - Builds cm_tcp.
make install - Installs cm_tcp in $HOME/bin/$ARCH.

4. Create the include.tar file, go to "include" and run: 

tar cvf include.tar *

5. The following files are ready for the cm_tcp software package distribution:

include/include.tar
$HOME/bin/$ARCH/cm_tcp
$HOME/bin/$ARCH/lb_create
$HOME/lib/$ARCH/libinfr.so
