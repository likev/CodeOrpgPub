cm_tcp is the comm_manager for the TCP/IP protocol. It can be used on a LAN
connection or on top of a PPP protocol on a WAN connection. 

cm_tcp receives and processes comm_manager requests from one of the RPG comms
request data stores. It sends comm_manager responses and events to the RPG
comms response data stores. cm_tcp implements multiple PVCs on each connection.
cm_tcp has code for establishing and shutting down TCP connections on both
client and server sides, sending and receiving user messages, processing
acknowledgements and detecting connection status. See RPG ICD and other
documents for additional details.

cm_tcp uses the following source files shared with other comm_managers:

cmc_common.c: Basic common routines for all comm_managers.

cmc_monitor.c: Interfacing with cm_ping for monitoring connection status to the
comms servers.

cmc_process_requests.c: Processing comm_manager requests and sending responses.

cmc_read_request.c: Receiving comm_manager requests.

cmc_rate.c: Routines for data rate estimation.

cm_tcp has the following source modules in addition to the shared modules:

cmt_config.c: Reading configuration files.

cmt_login.c: Sending, receiving and processing user login messages.

cmt_main.c: The main module.

cmt_shared.c: Routines shared by protocols.

cmt_sock.c: Socket interface routines.

cmt_tcp.c: cm_tcp routines for the TCP/IP protocol.

cmt_snmp.c: Uses the snmp libary to send snmp packets over the network 
            to manage hardware.
