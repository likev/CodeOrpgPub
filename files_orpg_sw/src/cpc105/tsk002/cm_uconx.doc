cm_uconx is the comm_manager for the PTI MPS600/800 communications server. One
instance of cm_uconx must be started for each MPS server. Because the MPS
server is not reliable, cm_uconx relies on cm_ping to terminate itself and
restart a new instance in case the MPS becomes nonresponsive. cm_uconx also
tries to reboot the MPS server in case of MPS failure. cm_uconx tries to make a
hard MPS reboot via sending a SNMP command to the power control device. If the
power control device is not available, it sends reboot command to MPS for a
soft reboot.

cm_uconx performs configuration on all ports when it is started. It receives
and processes comm_manager requests from one of the RPG comms request data
stores. It sends comm_manager responses and events to the RPG comms response
data stores. It interacts through the MPS client side API with MPS:
Enabing/disabling WAN, LAPB and X.25 streams. Transmitting and receiving user
data. Listening and responding to link state changes.

cm_uconx uses the following source files shared with other comm_managers:

cmc_common.c: Basic common routines for all comm_managers.

cmc_monitor.c: Interfacing with cm_ping for monitoring connection status to the
comms servers.

cmc_process_requests.c: Processing comm_manager requests and sending responses.

cmc_read_request.c: Receiving comm_manager requests.

cmc_rate.c: Routines for data rate estimation.

cm_uconx has the following source modules in addition to the shared modules:

cmu_conf_control.c: Routines for configuring MPS ports, enabling/disabling 
ports, enabling/disabling LAPB, sending RESTART/restart confirmation packets.

cmu_config.c: Reading configuration files.

cmu_dnetd.c: Implementing the local NC commands that replace the PTI's original
IPC based NC commands.

cmu_dnetd_label.c: Additional routines used by cmu_dnetd.c.

cmu_dnetd_mps.c: Additional routines used by cmu_dnetd.c.

cmu_hdlc_abm.c: cm_uconx routines for the LAPB/ABM protocol.

cmu_main.c: The main module.

cmu_shared.c: Routines shared by protocols.

cmu_x25_pvc.c: cm_uconx routines for the X.25/PVC protocol.
