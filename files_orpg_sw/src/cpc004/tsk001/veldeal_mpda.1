OVERVIEW

The veldeal task has been modified to include not only the legacy Velocity
Dealiasing Algorithm (VDA) but also the Multi-PRF Dealiasing Algorithm (MPDA). 
The main veldeal task, on activation, determines the Volume Coverage Pattern
(VCP) number of the incoming data.  Based on the VCP number it then calls either
the VDA or MPDA buffer control modules.  The respective buffer control modules
process the incoming raw base data until an end of elevation or an end of volume
condition is detected and veldeal becomes inactive.  VCP 121, when downloaded
from the ORPG to the RDA, causes the veldeal task to initiate the MPDA
processing.  This VCP has the same elevation angles as VCP 21 but completes a
volume scan every 5 rather than 6 minutes.

MPDA DESCRIPTION

     Overview

     The MPDA technique combines velocity data from multiple sweeps at the same
     elevation angle.  This accomplishes two things:  First, because each sweep
     has a different PRF with a corresponding different unambiguous range, 
     Doppler data that may be range folded at one PRF may not be range folded 
     at another PRF.  Range folding reduction of 50% to 70% is expected. 
     Second, where there are redundant velocity measurements, MPDA produces
     robustly dealiased velocity data.  Overall accuracy is comparable to
     velocity dealiasing using a high PRF number.  Spectrum width data are range
     unfolded at the same time as the velocity data.

     Data Input/Output
 
     Raw surveillance mode reflectivity data as they are acquired from the input
     buffer are immediately sent to the output buffer as RPG base data.  A copy
     of the data are saved for range unfolding the 2nd and 3rd velocity scans
     later.  Doppler velocity data, spectrum width data, and batch mode
     reflectivity data are not sent to the output buffer and not available for
     other algorithms to use until all required sweeps have been received and
     the MPDA has completed processing.  Once processing is completed, the RPG
     base data are sent out in a burst.  Above 4.3 degrees elevation, dealiasing
     reverts to the VDA.  Raw base data are received, velocity data dealiased,
     and all moments sent to the output buffer as RPG base data on a radial
     basis.

     Processing Steps

     After azimuthally aligning data from the multiple velocity sweeps, the MPDA
     attempts to dealias velocities all locations with three velocity estimates. 
     The three original velocities or velocities adjusted by the Nyquist co-
     interval must not differ by more than an threshold value.  The MPDA next
     attempts to dealias locations with only two velocity estimates or locations
     with three velocity estimates that could not be previously dealiased.  Next
     it attempts to find a solution using individual velocity estimates. 
     Finally, it fills in remaining locations with an un-dealiased velocity
     estimate that most closely matches its neighbors.  At all processing steps
     a candidate velocity solution must be within threshold difference of a
     "seed" velocity.  The seed values may come from a previously accepted
     solution, nearby averages, or the Environmental Wind Table.  After each key
     processing step, data quality modules correct for outliers, large velocity
     differences along a radial and runs of large azimuthal velocity differences.

VCP 121 Description

     VCP 121 collects data at nine unique elevation angles in every five minutes
     using a total of 20 sweeps.  MPDA is applied to the first 5 elevation
     angles while VDA is used for the remaining four higher elevation angles.  
     The scanning sequence is as follows:

     Sweep    PRF     Elev.     Data Mode
     -----    ---   --------  ----------------------------------
      1        1     0.5 deg  Surveillance
      2        8     0.5 deg  Contiguous Doppler (range unfolded)
      3        6     0.5 deg  Contiguous Doppler (range ambiguous)
      4        4     0.5 deg  Contiguous Doppler (range ambiguous)
      5        1     1.5 deg  Surveillance

     17       3,5    6.0 deg  Batch
     18        7     9.9 deg  Contiguous Doppler (range unfolded)     
     19        8    14.6 deg  Contiguous Doppler (range unfolded)

NOTES

     Auto PRF

     Toggling the Auto PRF function on while MPDA is running is allowed.
     However, the Auto PRF function will not download VCP 121 to the RDA with a
     new PRF.  The MPDA requires its own predefined PRFs to run correctly.

     GUI PRF Selection Tool

     The GUI PRF Selection Tool remains functional while in VCP 121 to help the
     user to decide if running in VCP 121 (MPDA) or using sectorized PRFs is
     more advantageous.

     Algorithm Performance

     Because of the time required to acquire two extra velocity scans (about 25
     seconds at the lower elevation angles), it is postulated that algorithms
     that build three-dimensional features by vertically associating two-
     dimensional features may not work as expected.  Tornadic signatures close
     to the radar may be lost due to weakened velocity gradients and feature
     translation.  Fast-moving weather events would increase the likelihood of a
     failure.  These problems have not been observed in the limited data sets on
     which the MPDA was developed and tested.
