control_rda is the RPG interface to the wideband communications manager.  
All incoming/outgoing messages from/to the RDA is serviced by control_rda.
control_rda also services wideband connection/disconnection commands.

Refer to control_rda(1) for further details.

control_rda consists of the following sources:

crda_main.c: Main module for control_rda.  Performs task initialization.
             Controls processing for this task.

crda_download_vcp.c: Converts interval format VCP to RPG/RDA ICD format.

crda_event_services.c: Contains the event handlers for events serviced
                       by control_rda.

crda_line_connect.c: Handles the wideband interface.  Processes connections
                     and disconnections of the wideband.

crda_message_converters.c: Used primarily for Big-Endian to Little-Endian (or
                           vice versa) conversion, it also performs floating
                           point conversion (legacy to IEEE 754).

crda_proc_rdamsg.c: RDA message processors.

crda_queue_services.c: Maintains the request queue for requests and data
                       passed from RPG and RDA.

crda_rda_control.c: Routines for building RDA Control Commands in RPG/RDA ICD
                    format. 

crda_receive_wb_data.c: Main interface for incoming RDA messages.  This module
                        directs the messages to messages processors found in
                        crda_proc_rdamsg.c.

crda_send_wideband_msg.c: Processes all outgoing RPG to RDA messages.

crda_set_comms_status.c: Maintains and publishes the communication line status.

crda_status.c: RDA status message processor.  Generates appropriate system 
               status log messages based on the RDA status.

crda_timer_services.c: Timer handlers for all timers used in control_rda.
