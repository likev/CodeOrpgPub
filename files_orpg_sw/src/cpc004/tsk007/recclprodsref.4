NAME:
        recclprodsref.lb - Clutter Likelihood Reflectivity: 11 level/0.54 nm

DESCRIPTION :
        The recclprodsref linear buffer contains product headers for the
        11-level/0.54 nm resolution, clutter likelihood reflectivity
        products. The products are output from the Radar Echo Classifier
        (REC) product producing task (recclprods), which gets its input
        from the REC algorithm task (recclalg) using an anomalous
        propagation(AP)/clutter target.
        
        The product displays the percentage likelihood that the radar
        is detecting AP/ground clutter in the reflectivity radials.
        
        The product header has an element labeled "len".  If the value
        in len is positive it's a pointer to an entry in the product
        data base where the product is stored.  If the value is
        negative it's an abort code. The products in the data base
        are referenced by volume, date/time, and elevation cut.

        and the associated product ID.
