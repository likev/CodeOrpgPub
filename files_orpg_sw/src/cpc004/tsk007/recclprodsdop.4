NAME:
        recclprodsdop.lb - Clutter Likelihood Doppler: 12 level/0.54 nm

DESCRIPTION :
        The recclprodsdop linear buffer contains product headers for the
        12 level/0.54 nm resolution, clutter likelihood Doppler products.
        The products are output from the Radar Echo Classifier (REC)
        product producing task (recclprods), which gets its input from
        the REC algorithm task (recclalg) using an anomalous propagation
        (AP)/clutter target.
        
        The product displays the percentage likelihood that the radar
        is detecting AP/ground clutter in the Doppler radials. This product
        reduces the resolution of the input intermediate product
        (RECCLDIGDOP) by retaining the maximum value of the four 0.13nm
        bins.
        
        The product header has an element labeled "len".  If the value
        in len is positive it's a pointer to an entry in the product
        data base where the product is stored.  If the value is
        negative it's an abort code. The products in the data base
        are referenced by volume, date/time, and elevation cut.
