NAME
pbd - Process Base Data

SYNOPSIS
pbd [options]

DESCRIPTION

   Process Base Data (pbd) performs r54 major functions:

     a. RDA VCP Data Processing

        Before the start of every volume scan, the RDA sends a VCP definition
        to the RPG.  This VCP definition is subsequently stored by pbd in ID 
        ORPGDAT_ADAPTATION, message ID RDA_RDACNT.  This definition reflects 
        what the RDA intends to execute for the upcoming volume scan.  If 
        Supplemental, Adaptive, Intra-volume Low-elevation Scan (SAILS) is 
        active, this definition contains the supplemental cuts.  Because SAILS
        can vary from volume scan to volume scan where the supplemental cuts
        are inserted, pbd maintains a short history of the RDA VCP definitions
        it posts to RDA_RDACNT.  This history is needed by the product scheduler
        to not only schedule products but accurately track products that are 
        generated.  Currently pbd maintains the current and previous volume 
        scans. 

        When SAILS is active, pbd inserts the supplemental cuts in the any VCP 
        definition received either in response to the Auto PRF function or manual
        download command.  The location of the supplemental cuts within the VCP
        will be based on the termination angle of the previous VCP (the previous 
        VCP may have been terminated early owing to Automated Volume Scan 
        Evaluation and Termination (AVSET)).  Also when SAILS is active,
        pbd checks when the last elevation is started and will adjust the VCP
        definition previously downloaded in the AVSET termination angle is 
        different than expected.
           
     b. Digital Radar Data Format Conversion

        Converts incoming Digital Radar Data format data (Refer to RDA/RPG 
        ICD) to internal RPG base data format for use by meteorological 
        algorithms.  In addition, for any low elevation cut whose data was 
        acquired in a two-pass process (first cut: surveillance; second cut: 
        Doppler) the following procedure is applied:

	  1) Save surveillance cut;

	  2) Identify surveillance radial whose azimuth angle is closest to 
             Doppler radial azimuth angle;

	  3) Combine surveillance and Doppler data into a single record with 
             azimuths labeled as on Doppler radial.

     c. Radial Status Processing

        Process Base Data monitors the radial status for start/end of volume
        and/or elevation.  The following actions are performed:

          Start Of Volume: 

             The VCP number is validated (i.e., the VCP has been defined 
             in RDACNT adaptation data).  Data will not be processed for an 
             invalid or undefined VCP number.

             If the VCP is valid, the volume scan sequence number is incremented,
             the volume status data is updated (data store ID ORPGDAT_GSM_DATA, 
             message ID VOL_STAT_GSM_ID), the scan summary data is updated (data 
             store ID ORPGDAT_GSM_DATA, message ID SCAN_SUMMARY_ID), and an 
             ORPGEVT_SCAN_INFO event it posted indicating the start of volume.  
             pbd also posts an ORPGEVT_START_OF_VOLUME_SCAN event and will 
             suspend processing of digital radar data until either the event 
             ORPGEVT_PROD_GEN_CONTROL is received or 5 seconds has 
             elapsed.  The ORPGEVT_PROD_GEN_CONTROL event signals pbd that the 
             product generation tables for the current volume scan have been 
             initialized.  Either way, an ORPGEVT_START_OF_VOLUME_DATA event
             is posted to indicate to downstream consumers that radial data 
             is being processed.

          Start Of Elevation:

             At start of elevation, the spot blanking status in the scan summary
             array is updated for the current elevation cut, then the 
             ORPGEVT_SCAN_INFO event is posted indicating start of elevation.  


          End of Elevation:
          End Of Volume:

             The ORPGEVT_SCAN_INFO event is posted indicating end of elevation
             or volume, respectively.

     d. Data Sequencing Error Detection and Recovery

        Process Base Data maintains two algorithm control variables in the RPG
        radial header: PBD_ALG_CONTROL and PBD_ABORTED_VOLUME  This information 
        is used by algorithms processes to perform corrective actions when data 
        sequencing errors are detected.  PBD_ALG_CONTROL is set to PBD_NORMAL if 
        none of the following errors are detected. 

	Detection of "Beginning of Elevation Cut" prior to receiving "End of 
	Elevation Cut" status for the same elevation cut in current Volume 
	Scan causes PBD_ALG_CONTROL to be set to PBD_ABORT_FOR_NEW_VV.  
        PBD_ABORTED_VOLUME is set to the current volume scan number.  If
        the RDA is in REMOTE CONTROL and not PLAYBACK, pbd issues a volume
        scan restart.  Otherwise, pbd waits till start of volume.   Any Base 
        Data received prior to detection of a "Beginning of Volume Scan" status 
        is not processed.  The unexpected start of elevation cut is recorded in
        the system status log.

	Detection of "Beginning of Volume Scan" prior to receiving "End of 
	Volume Scan" causes PBD_ALG_CONTROL to be set to PBD_ABORT_FOR_NEW_EV. 
        The PBD_ABORTED_VOLUME is set to the previous volume scan number.  The
        unexpected start of volume scan is recorded in the system status log.

	Detection of "Beginning of Elevation Cut of an elevation angle other 
	than what was expected or the beginning of a different elevation angle 
	prior to completion of the previous elevation angle causes PBD_ALG_CONTROL 
        to be set to PBD_ABORT_FOR_NEW_VV and PBD_ABORTED_VOLUME to be set to
        the current volume scan number.  If the RDA is in REMOTE CONTROL and not 
        PLAYBACK, pbd issues a volume scan restart.  Otherwise, pbd waits till
        start of volume.   Any Base Data received prior to detection of a 
        "Beginning of Volume Scan" status is not processed.  The unexpected 
        elevation cut is recorded in the system status log.

	Detection of an azimuthal angle difference greater than 2 degrees within 
	an elevation cut causes automatic elevation restart if RDA is in REMOTE 
        CONTROL and not PLAYBACK.  If the elevation cut is the first cut of the 
        volume, then a volume scan restart if issued.  If the RDA is in LOCAL 
        CONTROL or PLAYBACK, pbd stops processing data until start of next volume 
        scan. The occurrence of the "fat" radial is recorded in the system status 
        log.

        Detection of an elevation angle difference greater than 0.5 degrees from 
        that expected (as defined by adaptation data) causes pbd to set the 
        elevation angle to that expected.  The elevation out of tolerance is 
        recorded in the system status log.

     3) Radial Accounting

        Process Base Data maintains radial accounting data.  Data include 
        date/times for start/end of elevation/volume, number of radials per 
        elevation, elevation angle of each cut, and start/stop azimuth of end and
        pseudo end of elevation/volume.  This information is stored in data store
        ID ORPGDAT_ACCDATA.  

        Furthermore, every 4 seconds pbd checks and reports the input buffer load.
        The input buffer load is the ratio of unread messages to total messages in
        the communication manager response buffer expressed as a percent.  This
        value provides an indication of whether or not the RPG is keeping up with
        the input radial rate.
