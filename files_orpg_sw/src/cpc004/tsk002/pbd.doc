pbd processes digital radar data and converts data to RPG internal 
format for use by meteorological algorithms.  It performs data
sequencing error checks and performs corrective actions when errors
occur.  It also maintains and publishes the scan summary and volume
status data.  Finally, it posts the scan information events which
occur at start/end of elevation/volume.    

Refer to pbd(1) for further details.

pbd consists of the following sources:

pbd.c: Main processing module for processing base data.  Services
       CPC4MSG and ORPGDAT_RDA_COMMAND messages.

pbd_process_data.c: Performs split cut processing, performs some
                    data sequencing error checks, and moves moment
                    data from digital radar data message to RPG
                    internal format message.

pbd_process_header.c: Builds the RPG internal format radial header
                      from the digital radar data message.  Performs
                      some data sequencing error checks.

pbd_set_scan_summary.c:  Maintains and publishes the scan summary data.

pbd_set_vcpid_wmode.c:  Maintains and publishes the volume status data.
