NAME:
       hhc8bit

DESCRIPTION :
        Hybrid Hydrometeor Classification 8-bit Product - Part of the Dual
        Polarization implementation, this task ingests the hybrid
        hydrometeor classification data from the Quantitiative
        Precipitation Estimation Rate algorithm (qperate) once per
        volume scan and produces the following product:
			HHC (177) Hybrid Hydrometeor Classification

        This product represents the hydrometeor classification used at
        each sample bin for the QPE's precipitation rate calculation.  The
        HHC data has also been smoothed using a mode-9 filter.
