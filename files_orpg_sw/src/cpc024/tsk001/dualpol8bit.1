NAME:
       dualpol8bit

DESCRIPTION :
        Dual Polarization 8-bit Products - Part of the Dual Polarization
        implementation, this task ingests radials from the Hydrometeor
        Classification Algorithm (hca) and produces the following four
        elevation-based products:
			DZD (159) Differential Reflectivity
               DCC (161) Correlation Coefficient
               DKD (163) Specific Differential Phase
               DHC (165) Hydrometeor Classification

        Note that this process can also be configured to create several
        additional non-operational products for debugging purposes.
        Currently, these are:  smoothed reflectivity (smz8bit), signal-to-
        noise ratio (snr8bit), differential phase (phi8bit) and texture of
        reflectivity (sdz8bit).
