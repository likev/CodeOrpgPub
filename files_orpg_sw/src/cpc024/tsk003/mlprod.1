NAME:
       mlprod

DESCRIPTION :
        Melting Layer Product - Part of the Dual Polarization
        implementation, this task ingests radials from the Hydrometeor
        Classification Algorithm (hca) and produces the following
        elevation-based product:
			ML (166) Melting Layer

        This product is intended as an overlay on other elevation-based
        geographic radar products.  It contains up to four contours as
        follows:
            Innermost (closest to the radar):  range at which the radar
                 beam top first intersects the bottom of the melting
                 layer.
            Next innermost:  range at which the radar beam center
                 intersects the melting layer bottom.
            Next innermost:  range at which the radar beam center
                 intersects the melting layer top.
            Outermost (farthest from the radar):  range at which the
                 radar beam bottom intersects the melting layer top.
