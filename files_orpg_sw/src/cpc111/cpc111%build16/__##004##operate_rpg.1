NAME
    operate_rpg - task that allows a user to run RPG in the rpg account 
    without rpg login.

SYNOPSIS
    operate_rpg [-fbv]

DESCRIPTION
    operate_rpg allows a permitted user to change the user's login user ID and
    group ID to become the RPG login and then run RPG as if the user is logged
    in the rpg account. This allows multiple RPG operators to run the same RPG
    installation without the permission to actually log in the rpg account. By
    not allowing operators to directly log in the rpg account, the operators of
    the RPG can be individually traced and audited. When a user enters into or
    leaves from rpg account through operate_rpg, a message is logged in the
    operate_rpg log file /var/log/operate_rpg.log.

    operate_rpg uses a configuration file to get the list of all users that are
    permitted to operate RPG. The operate_rpg configuration file and
    operate_rpg log file must be owned by the root and writable only by the
    root user. The executable file of operate_rpg must be owned by the root
    user and has "u+s" permission bit set. The default name of the operate_rpg
    configuration file is /etc/operate_rpg.conf. An alternative file name can
    be specified with the -f command line option.

    operate_rpg, with the -c option provides a mechanism to allow a user to run
    a command in the RPG environment. The command executed is specified in the
    operate_rpg configuration file after label "cmd_lable_command" where
    "cmd_label" is specified with the -c option. The procedure of executing the
    command is the following: Change the user ID and group ID to those of the
    rpg account; Set the HOME environment variable to be the path of the rpg
    home directory; Run the mrpg automatic startup command in the bash
    environment. To do these, operate_rpg executes the following command (in
    bash, the default shell):

	HOME=RPG_home; export HOME; cd $HOME; /bin/bash -l -c "command"

    where "RPG_home" is the rpg account home directory and "command" is the
    specified command.

    operate_rpg, with -b option, provides the mechanism to automatically start
    RPG after the OS is booted. This option is equivalent to "-c
    RPG_boot_start". In order for this to work, the RPG startup command must be
    specified after label "RPG_boot_start_command" in the operate_rpg
    configuration file.

    An example of the operate_rpg configuration file consists the following:

	# RPG configuration file

	RPG_uid		204
	RPG_gid		200
	RPG_home	/export/home/rpg

	RPG_boot_start_command	mrpg -v auto_start

	mscf_command	mscf_cmd &

	Operator_uid	0		# root
	Operator_uid	1010		# the first operator
	Operator_uid	202		# the second operator

    If we add the line 

	nm:3:once:/usr/bin/operate_rpg -b > /var/log/run_operate_rpg.log 2>&1

    in the /etc/inittab file, RPG will be started automatically upon OS bootup.
    Here we assume operate_rpg is installed in /usr/bin. Note that, in order
    for this to work, the root user (0) must be in the permission list in the
    operate_rpg configuration file.

    In -b mode, operate_rpg error logs go to the operate_rpg log file.
    Otherwise, error logs go to the standard error port.

OPTIONS
    -f	conf_file_name
	Specifies an alternative operate_rpg configuration file name. The 
	default is "/etc/operate_rpg.conf".

    -c	cmd_label
	Specifies an command to run in the RPG environmant.

    -b	Runs mrpg automatic startup command to start RPG after OS bootup.

    -v	Verbose mode.

EXAMPLES
    Example 1: operate_rpg
	Enter into the rpg account.

    Example 2: operate_rpg -f /export/home/rpg/cfg/operate_rpg.conf
	Enter into the rpg account using a non-default configuration file.

    Example 3: operate_rpg -b
	Run automatic RPG startup (from the root account). This is not normally
	done on the command line other than for test purpose.

    Example 4: operate_rpg -c mscf
	Enter into the rpg account, run command "mscf_cmd &" and terminate.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
    none.

EXIT STATUS
    0:		Terminated normally. 

    non-zero:	Terminated because an error was detected.

FILES
    operate_rpg configuration file
	Must have the right owner and permission. The default is 
	"/etc/operate_rpg.conf". 

    /var/log/operate_rpg.log
	The operate_rpg log file. It is created by operate_rpg. Must have the 
	right owner and permission.

SEE ALSO
    mrpg(1), setuid(2), inittab(4)

NOTES
    The current implementation assumes that RPG uses bash. This can be extended
    to configurable shell types.
