DESCRIPTION
	One of these response LB files exist for each p_server instance.
	ORPGDAT_OT_RESPONSE is added to the p_server instance number to yield the
	LB number.  These must be defined in the system configuration file (sys_cfg).
	These LBs contain the responses to the requests for products that
	were issued by users, or that were triggered by alert processing.
	
	The response messages have the structure defined by One_time_prod_req_response
	in  prod_distri_info.h.
	
EVENTS 
	The (ORPGEVT_OT_RESPONSE + p_server instance number) event is posted when a 
	new message is written to this LB.
