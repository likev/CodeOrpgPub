This file describes the precipitation accumulation algorithm

DESCRIPTION :
        The precipitation accumulation algorithm takes the precipitation rate
        from the current and previous scan and computes the precipitation
        accumulation for each box for the scan period, generating a scan-to-scan
        accumulation. It also keeps a one hour running total of the
        precipitation accumulation.
        The NAR option of expressing precipiation accumulations and rates in
        linear units is specified. A rate of less than 0.05 mm/hr and an
        accumulation of 0.05 mm will be considered a rate of zero or an
        accumulation of zero respectively.
