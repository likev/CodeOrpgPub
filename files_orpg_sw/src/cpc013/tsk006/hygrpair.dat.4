NAME
HYGRPAIR.DAT - Precipitation Gage Radar Pairs Data File

FILETYPE
Disk File

DESCRIPTION
The legacy file is implemented in the ORPG as a disk file.

This file is maintained and accessed by cpc013 tsk006 prcpadju
(Precipitation Adjustment Algorithm).

Legacy RPG I/O for this file is supported by replacement ANSI 77 code
placed directly in the legacy Fortran source files.

The disk file is opened as a direct-access file with a record length that
corresponds to the size of the legacy Gage/Radar Pair (600 bytes).
So, a legacy RPG call to perform SYSIO at a given sector maps to an ANSI 77
READ or WRITE to the corresponding record.

There are 150 elements in the Gage/Radar Pair database (3 sensors by
maximum of 50 gages).

The structure of the file as as follows (refer to a313h.inc):

                                                Length
        Record                                  (bytes)
        -----------------------------------     -------
         1 Gage/Radar Pair Database               600
