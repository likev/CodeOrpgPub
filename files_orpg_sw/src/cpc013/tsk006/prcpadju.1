NAME:
       prcpadju

DESCRIPTION :
        Precipitation Adjustment Algorithm - This algorithm takes the
        Precipitation Accumulation intermediate product and produces the
	Precipitation Adjustment intermediate product.

	It ingests the Scan-to-Scan Accumulation field and the Hourly
	Accumulation field from the input, linear buffer and a Bias Table
	containing mean-field Bias Correction factors determined, via rain
	gauge-radar comparisons over different time periods, from AWIPS.  
	(The Bias Table is, typically, updated once per hour).  The algorithm
	then utilizes adaptation data thresholds to select the "Best Bias"
	from among those in the table.  That Best Bias may then, optonally,
	be applied (in the form of a multiplicative correction) to the
	Scan-to-Scan Accumulation and Hourly Accumulation fields before their
	use in summing the point-by-point rainfall totals (at az/ran gridpoints)
	in the various PPS rainfall accumulation products.  The option of
	whether or not to apply the correction is made by the operator via
	an adaptable flag known as the "Bias Appied Flag", selectable at
	the HCI menu.
