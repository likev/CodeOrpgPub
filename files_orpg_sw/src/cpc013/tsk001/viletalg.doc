This file describes the VIL/echo tops algorithm.

DESCRIPTION :
        The VIL algorithm converts the reflectivity data into equivalent liquid
        water values. The values are derived for each 2.2 X 2.2 nm grid box,
        then vertically integrated. VIL values are output in units of mass per
        area. The algorithm assumes relfectivity returns are from liquid.
        Reflectivity returns from hail result in unrealistically high values, so
        all reflectivities greater than 55 dbz are truncated to 55 dbz.
        The echo top algorithm measures height where rflectivity is greater than
        or equal to 18.3 dbz for each 2.2 X 2.2 nm grid box. It is used to
        identify storms with greater vertical development and differentiate real
        echoes from non-precipitation echoes.
