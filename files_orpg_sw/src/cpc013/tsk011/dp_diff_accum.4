NAME:
        Dual Pol Difference Accumulation Data Store

DESCRIPTION:
        The DP_DIFF_ACCUM.DAT data store contains a collection of
        scan-to-scan (S2S) accumulation buffers for an hourly difference backup.
        The format of each buffer is a S2S_Accum_Buf_t structure
        defined in include/dp_s2s_accum_types.h.

        The collection of accumulation buffers in DP_DIFF_ACCUM is tied
        to the circular queue of metadata with LB_id_t HOURLY_DIFF_ID
        in the DP_HRLY_BACKUP data store.
