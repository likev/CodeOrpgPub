This file describes the storm centroids algorithm.

DESCRIPTION :
        The storm centroids algorithm groups segments into two dimensional
        components, vertically correlates these components and calculates these
        cell's attributes. Components are then vertically correlated into three
        dimensional cells. A cell's location is identified by it's three
        dimensional center or centroid.
