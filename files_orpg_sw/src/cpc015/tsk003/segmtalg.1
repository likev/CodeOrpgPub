NAME:
       segmtalg

DESCRIPTION :
        Storm Segments/Components Algorithm - This algorithm takes Reflectivity
        Data and produces the Storm Cell Segments Algorithm intermediate
        product.
	
	It is optional to use the filtered relfectivity as input. When the parameter
	FILTERED is assigned with TRUE value, the input reflectivity is median
	filtered (or smoothed) using a kernel which adjusts for different ranges.
	Small storm fragments are removed or merged with larger cells. Original 
	reflectivity data are used to determine storm attributes (maximum reflectivity 
 	of segment). As a result, fewer larger storms are identified, tracking is more 
	successful than baseline and the storm attributes are very close to baseline.

	Two parameters must be set before the filter functions will be called: 
	"KERNEL_SIZE" is the kernel size in meter (defaut value 7000M);
	"FRACTION_REQUIRED" is the maximum alowed percentage of the missing 
	data (default 50%).


	An intermediate producttion_based product 400 (FILTREF) will be created if the 
	parameter FILTERED_REFL has the 'TRUE' value. The format of this product is 
	exactly same as the format of the product 302 (REFLDATA_ELEV).
