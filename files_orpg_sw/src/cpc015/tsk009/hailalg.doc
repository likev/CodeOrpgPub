File name hailalg.doc.

This file describes the storm structure/hail algorithm.

DESCRIPTION :
        The storm structure/hail algorithm will provide, for each identified
        storm, a history of storm cell attributes.  The algorithm will also
        provide, for each storm identified, an indication the storm identified
        will produce severe (3/4 inch) hail, the maximum hail size produced by
        the storm, and the hail index. The information will be updated every
        volume scan.
