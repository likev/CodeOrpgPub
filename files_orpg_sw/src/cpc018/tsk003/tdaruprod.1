NAME:
	tdaruprod

DESCRIPTION:
	Tornado Vertex Signature Rapid Update (tdaruprod) generates
	an elevation based final product (TRU) at the end of each 
	elevation cut. It takes three inputs from linear buffer 290,
	295, and 50. 
	
	If previous volume contains any features, these features will
	be extrapolated to the positions in current volume based on 
	storm speed and direction information from MDA and SCIT. The 
	newly detected features in current volume will then be matched
	to previous volume features. If no match found, the features 
	just detected will be treated as new features. 

	As the part of the TRU project, the task tda2d3dru is needed 
	to create elevation based intermediate product 290. The 
	tda2d3dru is just modification of existing tda2d3d.
