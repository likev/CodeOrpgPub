This file contains information about the Initialize RDA Alarm Messages 
(mnttsk_rda_alarms) maintenance task.  It is intended to be used by those
interested in how the software is designed rather than by a typical user.
More detailed information about data stores and events used by this task is
presented.

Design
------

The mnttsk_rda_alarms task is an operational tool used to initialize the RPG
data store contianing RDA alarm messages.  RDA alarm messages are created by
the RPG from the RDA alarm elements in RDA status messages.  Since the RPG
only maintains the latest RDA status message, the RDA alarms data store was
created to keep a history of RDA alarms.  The number of RDA alarms that the RDA
alarms data store can hold is configurable (defined in "data_tables").  In an
operational environment, the control_rda task checks the alarm code elements of
new RDA status messages.  If alarm codes are detected, the alarm codes are
written individually to the RDA alarms data store along with date/time
information.  for more information on the Initialize RDA Alarm Messages 
maintenance task refer to the man page mnttsk_rda_alarms(1).
