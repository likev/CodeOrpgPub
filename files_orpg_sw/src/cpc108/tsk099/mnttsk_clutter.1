DESCRIPTION

   This process performs Clutter file initialization.

   The startup action can take on one of the following values:  "startup",
   "restart", and "clear".  For each action, the following steps are performed: 

   startup:

      1)  Initializes the Clutter Filter Notchwidth Map data if the data
          does not exist (LB message ID LBID_NOTCHMAP in LB ID 
          ORPGDAT_CLUTTERMAP). 

      2)  Initializes the Clutter Filter Bypass Map data if the data does
          not exist (LB message ID LBID_BYPASSMAP in LB ID ORPGDAT_CLUTTERMAP).
          If the bypass map data is initialized, so is the Edited Clutter 
          Filter Bypass Map data (LB message ID LBID_EDITED_BYPASSMAP in LB 
          ID ORPGDAT_CLUTTERMAP). 

      3)  Initializes the Clutter Filter Sensor Zone data if the data does
          not exist (LB message ID LBID_CENSOR_ZONES in LB ID ORPGDAT_CLUTTERMAP).
          If the sensor zone data is initialized, so is the baseline sensor zone
          data (LB ID LBID_BASELINE_CENSOR_ZONES in LB ID ORPGDAT_CLUTTERMAP).

   restart:
   clear:

      There are no actions defined for these startup modes/actions.
