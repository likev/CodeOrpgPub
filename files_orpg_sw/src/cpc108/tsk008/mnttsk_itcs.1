NAME
   mnttsk_itcs - Initialization Task For Legacy Intertask Common (ITC)

SYNOPSIS
   mnttsk_itcs [-t action] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

This process performs intertask common (ITC) initialization in support of the 
legacy algorithms.  The ITC numbering convention is:

    (ITC_MIN + n)*ITC_IDRANGE + m

where ITC_MIN and ITC_IDRANGE are defined in rpg_port.h and have values 
1000 and 100, respectively.  (ITC_MIN + n)*ITC_IDRANGE refers to the ITC
ID (i.e., LB ID) and m is the message ID within the ITC.   

Header file itc.h and include file itc.inc define each ITC.  Each ITC corresponds
to a legacy common block.  Refer to the include file itc.inc for the ITC to 
common block mapping.  Refer to itc.h or the legacy include file for ITC
format.

The startup mode can take on one of the following values:  "startup",
"restart" or "clear".  For each mode, the following actions are performed: 

   startup:

      Initialize ITC's 100100, 100200, 100400, 100500, 100600, and 100600.

   restart:

      There are no initialization duties defined for this mode.

   clear:
  
      Initialize ITC 100200.
      

ITC 100100 consists of 9 messages (1-9).

Initialization involves assigning values to individual common block 
elements then the ITC message is written to the ITC LB.  The values
assigned to common block elements are identical to those defined in 
the legacy block data for the common block.  In most cases, all common
block elements are assigned the value 0.  The exceptions are message 1
and 5.  Refer to block data file a3cd09.ftn for initialization values 
for these messages.  

ITC 100200 consists of 2 messages (1 and 4).

      4           A3CD07           a309.inc, **A3CD07

Include file itc.inc defines which common block elements of A3CD07
are included in each of the ITC messages.  If the startup mode is 
"startup", each ITC message is checked for existence.  No initialization 
is performed if message exists since this data is considered state
information.  Otherwise, elements are initialized accordingly.  If startup
mode is "clear", each ITC message is initialized regardless of message 
existence.

ITC 100400 consists of 2 messages (1 and 2).

      1           A3CD97           a309.inc, **A3CD97

Include file itc.inc defines which common block elements of A3CD97
are included in ITC message 1.  If the startup mode is "startup",
the ITC message elements are initialized according to legacy block 
data file a3CD97.ftn.

There is no initialization defined for ITC message 2.

ITC 100500 consists of 5 messages (1-5).

      5           A3136C3          a313h.inc, **A3136C3

If the startup mode is "startup", the ITC message 5 elements are 
initialized to 0 prior to writing the message. There is no 
initialization defined for ITC messages 1-4.

ITC 100600 consists of 2 messages (1 and 2).

      2           A3052U           a305.inc, **A3052U

If the startup mode is "startup", common block elements are initialized 
to 0 prior to writing each ITC message.

ITC 100700 consists of 2 messages (1 and 3).

Both message formats are defined in itc.inc or itc.h.  For startup mode 
"startup", the message elements are initialized, then written to ITC LB.

Options
	-t mode		startup mode.  Determines which initialization actions to
                        be performed.  Supported startup modes are "startup",
                        "restart" and "clear".  By default, the mode is "restart".  

	-h		Provides command line help.
