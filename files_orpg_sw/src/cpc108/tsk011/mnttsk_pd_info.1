NAME

   mnttsk_pd_info - Initialization Task for Product Attribute Table (PAT),
                    Narrowband Line Table, and Narrowband User Profiles.

SYNOPSIS
   mnttsk_pd_info [-t mode] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   This task performs initialization of the Product Attribute Table (PAT),
   the narrowband line table, and narrowband user profiles.  Initialization
   activities depend on the startup mode/action (see Options).   The activities
   are described here:

   clear:

      Initialize the PAT, line table, and user profiles.

   restart:
   startup:

      The initialization performed for startup modes "restart" and "startup"
      are identical.  The following actions are performed:

      1)   The PAT is initialized.  

      2)   If the Line Table does not exist (LB message ID PD_LINE_INFO_MSG_ID)
           in LB ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO, it is initialized.  Otherwise, no 
           initialization is performed.

      3)   If the User Profiles do not exist (LB ORPGDAT_USER_PROFILES), it is
           initialized.  Otherwise, no initialization is performed.

   Options
	-t mode/action	startup mode/action.  Determines which initialization
			actions are to be performed.  Supported startup modes 
			or actions are "startup", "restart", and "clear".
  			By default, the mode is "restart".  

	-h		Provides command line help.
