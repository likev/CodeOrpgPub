NAME
   mnttsk_loadshed - Initialization Task For Hydromet Files

SYNOPSIS
   mnttsk_loadshed [-t action] [-h]

DESCRIPTION

   This process performs loadshed file initialization.

   The startup action can take on one of the following values:  "startup"
   or "restart".  

   startup:

      The ASCII load shed table "load_shed_table" is parsed.  Elements of
      the binary loadshed table (LB ID ORPGDAT_LOAD_SHED_CAT.4) are initialized
      using the ORPGLOAD_* family of functions.  The binary loadshed table 
      consists of LB message IDs LOAD_SHED_THRESHOLD_BASELINE_MSG_ID,
      LOAD_SHED_THRESHOLD_MSG_ID, and LOAD_SHED_CURRENT_MSG_ID.

   restart:

      There are no actions currently defined for "restart".  It is assumed 
      if restarting that the loadshed table exists.


   Options
	-t mode		startup mode.  Determines which initialization actions to
                        be performed.  Supported startup modes are "startup" and
                        "restart".  By default, the mode is "restart".  

	-h		Provides command line help.
