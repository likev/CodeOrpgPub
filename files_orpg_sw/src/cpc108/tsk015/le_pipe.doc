	Read stdin one line at a time and write each line
      into an LE log file.  Refer to le_pipe.1 for more
      information.  This program simply does blocking reads
      in stdin.  If no input is available this program will
      be blocked/sleeping.  When input is available, it simply
      writes each line into an LE log file.  If a line is too
      long for an LE message, the line will be split into
      smaller chunks.  When reading from stdin, this program
      has special code to retry I/O when an interruption occurs.
