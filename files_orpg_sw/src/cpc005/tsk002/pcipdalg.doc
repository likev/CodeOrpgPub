This file describes the precipitation detection algorithm.

DESCRIPTION :
        The precipitation detection algorithm processes each full volume
        reflectivity scan in order to perform three basic functions. It detects
        whether precipitation has occurred within a 230km radius of the WSR-88D
        radar and assigns a precipitaion category appropiate to the situation.
        It maintains a precipitation status message which indicates the
        operational mode and the precipitation category.
