NAME
rms_statlog - Stores status messages when the interface is down.


DESCRIPTION

        When the ORPG/RMS interface is down, SYSLOG messages normally sent to
        the FAA/RMMS are stored in this linear buffer.  The messages are saved
        until the interface is reconnected.  When ORPG/RMS determines the
        interface has been restored the messages are then sent to the FAA/RMS.

        This is a local linear buffer used only by the ORPG/RMS interface. It is
        created when the interface is initialized and removed when the interface
        is shutdown. During a "reset" all the messages in the linear buffer are
        sent to the FAA/RMMS and then the linear buffer is cleared to remove the
        old messages. The linear buffer is located in the "tmp" directory.
