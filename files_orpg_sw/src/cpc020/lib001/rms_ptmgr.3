NAME
rms_ptmgr - Library routines used by ORPG/RMS to read and write messages to
the FAA/RMMS.

SYNOPSIS
        #include <rms_ptmgr.h>

        int rms_ptmgr ();
        void ptmgr_send_msg();
        int rms_close_ptmgr();


DESCRIPTION :

      The port manager library sends and receives all messages to and from the
      FAA/RMMS using an RS-232 asynchronous direct connection.  Messages
      are sent in a series of 7-bit unsigned bytes ending in a terminator
      consisting of hex 7Fs in the last four bytes of the message.

      The port manager forks a child process that listens to the port and detects
      incoming messages from the FAA/RMMS.  When a message is received, the port
      manager reads the message from the port and places it in the rms input
      linear buffer then posts an event to call the main interface.

      When a message is to be sent to the FAA/RMMS, the rms interface writes
      it to the rms output linear buffer and posts an event that calls the port manager.
      The port manager reads the outgoing message from the output linear buffer
      and sends it to the FAA/RMMS as a stream of 7-bit unsigned bytes.

Options: None
