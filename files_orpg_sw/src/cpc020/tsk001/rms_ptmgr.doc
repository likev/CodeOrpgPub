rms_ptmgr - Library routines used by ORPG RMS to read and write to the
RS-232 port.  Linear buffers are used to input FAA/RMMS messages into the
ORPG/RMS interface and to send messages from the ORPG/RMS interface to the
FAA/RMMS.

FILENAMES and CALLS

        int rms_ptmgr ();

        void ptmgr_send_msg();

The library consists of the following sources

rms_ptmgr( ) is used to initialize the RS-232 port. The port manger determines
which port the computer will use to connect to the FAA/RMMS based on the
argument supplied with the initial call. The port is then set to wake up every
1/100th of a second or whenever a minimum of 18 characters are received. The
port is set to operate at 9600 baud for both input and output speed.

After initializing the port, the port manager forks a child routine call listen.
The listen routine monitors the port for messages.  When a message is detected
listen reads the message and checks it for size. If the message is over 18 
characters long and less than the max message size, it is written to the rms
input linear buffer. The listen process will then send an event telling the
ORPG/RMS that a message is in the input linear buffer.

ptmgr_send_msg( ) reads the message from the rms output linear buffer and writes
it to the port one byte at a time.

rms_close_ptmgr( ) kills the listen routine when the interface is shutdown.
