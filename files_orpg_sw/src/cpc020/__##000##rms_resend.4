NAME
rms_resend - Stores messages that may be resent to the FAA/RMMS.


DESCRIPTION

        When the ORPG/RMS interface sends a message to the FAA/RMMS it
        stores a copy of the message in this linear buffer.  The lb id of the
        message is stored in a resend array until an acknowledgement is received
        from the FAA/RMMS. When the FAA/RMMS acknowledges the message, the lb id
        is removed from the resend array and the message is considered sent. The
        message stored in this linear buffer can then be overwritten. If an
        acknowledgement is not received, the ORPG/RMS will resend the message at
        least 3 times, once every 20 seconds, until it is acknowledged or the
        interface is considered down.

        This is a local linear buffer used only by the ORPG/RMS interface. It is
        created when the interface is initialized and removed when the interface
        is shutdown. The linear buffer is cleared during a "reset" to remove any
        old messages. The linear buffer is located in the "tmp" directory.
