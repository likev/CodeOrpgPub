NAME
rms_util - Library utility routines used by ORPG/RMS to perfom functions
needed by multiple rms_message, rms_ptmgr, and rms_interface calls.

DESCRIPTION :

      The utility library is used by the other rms libraries, and the interface.
      The main purpose of the utility library is to centralize those functions
      that are needed by multiple users.

      The primary purpose of the utility library is to provide routines for the
      conversion of unsigned bytes into a format usable by the interface.  It
      also converts standard formats into unsigned bytes so they can be placed
      into the outgoing messages to the FAA/RMMS.

      The utility library provides functions that extract information from
      the ORPG adaptation linear buffers.  It also contains security functions
      such as checking passwords, and retrieving, and setting the lock status
      of the RDA and ORPG command linear buffers.

      Finally the utility library provides a method for doing housework such as
      initializing buffers with zeros, and swapping bytes if necessary.

Options: None
