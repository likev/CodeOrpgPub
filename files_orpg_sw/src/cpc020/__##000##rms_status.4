NAME
rms_statlog - Stores status messages when the interface is down.


DESCRIPTION

        This linear buffer is used to store the status of the RDA and ORPG
        command buffer locks.  This allows the ORPG/RMS to reset the locks to
        the previous settings whenever the interface has been shut down. It can
        also be used to store any other information that might be considered
        necessary for interface restoration.

        This is a local linear buffer used only by the ORPG/RMS interface. It is
        created when the interface is initialized. The linear buffer is located
        in the "tmp" directory.
