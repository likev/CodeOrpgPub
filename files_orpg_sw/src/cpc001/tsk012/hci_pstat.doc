This file contains information about the HCI Products in Database task.  It
is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed
rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores
and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Products in Database task was created as a sub task in the HCI family of
tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the
"Products in Database" pushbutton in the RPG Products submenu of the RPG
Control/Status task.  However, as a stand-alone application, it can be launched
from the command line using the "hci_pstat" command or by invoking a system
call in any other application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has
a number of benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task
(hci.doc).

The Products in Database task provides functionality provided by the "PRODUCTS
IN THE DATABASE" menu in the legacy UCP.  A full description can be found in
the man page hci_pstat(1).

The Products in the Database window cannot be resized directly by the user.
Horizontal and Vertical scrollbars are provided to navigate through the product
list.

The Products in Database window is very simple.  It basically consists of two
combo box menus and a product list.  One menu defines the volume time of the
product(s) and the second menu defines the product(s) for the list.  A single
volume time or all volume times can be selected.  A single product or all
products can be selected.  All times and all products cannot be selected at
the same time since the number of query matches could exceed the product list
limit.

The timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  The Products in
Database window is updated under the following conditions:

	The volume number has changed
	
The menus are updated automatically when a new volume is started or when a
menu item is selected.


Testing
-------

To test this function fully one must have the RPG running and ingesting base
data so the algorithms can generate products.
