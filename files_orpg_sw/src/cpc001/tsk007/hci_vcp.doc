This file contains information about the HCI VCP Control task.  It is intended
to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather than by a
typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events used by
this task is presented.

Design
------

The VCP COntrol task was created as a sub task in the HCI family of tasks.  A
typical user would normally activate it by selecting the "VCP" pushbutton to
the right of the radome object in the RPG Control/Status window.  However, as a
stand-alone application, it can be launched from the command line using the
"hci_vcp" command or by invoking a system call in any other application wishing
to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of benefits which are
described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The VCP Control task includes the VCP data functionality provided by the legacy
UCP "Volume Coverage Pattern" menu and the VCP components in the "RDA Control"
menu.  A full description can be found in the man page hci_vcp(1).

The Control VCP window cannot be resized.  The Modify VCP Adaptation Data
window cannot be resized by the user.  It is automatically resized to fit the
number of cuts contained in the selected VCP. 

There is a requirement to restrict editing VCP adaptation data to the URC level
user.  A valid password must be entered before any editing can be performed.

An advisory lock is placed on the data message corresponding to the VCP
adaptation data message (RDACNT) in the ORPGDAT_ADAPTATION linear buffer when
the window is unlocked for editing.  If another instance of the task is running
and unlocked, a warning popup is displayed advising the user that the message
is currently being edited by another user.  When the  window is locked, the
advisory lock is removed.

The currently active VCP is displayed with a white background.  The information
that determines the VCP and whether it is a local or remote pattern is found
in the latest RDA Status message.

The timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  The VCP Control window
is update under the following conditions:

	New RDA Status data available
	New RPG Status data available
	Auto PRF flag changed

Testing
-------

To test this function fully, a live RDA is needed.  However, the RDA simulator
can be used to test the GUI behavior (i.e., change to local or remote patterns,
restart VCP or cut).  The rda status and wideband status test tools, rdastat
and wb_stat, can be used to change RDA and wideband status in order to test
button sensitivity under various conditions.  For example, the wb_stat tool
can be used to change the RDA/RPG wideband state to/from connected.  If the
wideband is not connected, all VCP control buttons should be desensitized with
the exception of modifying VCP adaptation data.  The same is true if the
wideband is connected but the RDA is in local control.
