NAME

hci_vcp

SYNOPSIS

hci_vcp [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_vcp" command invokes the VCP Control task for the RPG.  It is a GUI
based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is part of the
Human-Computer Interface  (HCI) family of tasks, typically launched from the
RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can be run
as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_vcp recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The VCP and Mode Control task provides a graphical user interface to change and
edit Volume Control Patterns (VCPs), auto-switching of modes, and default
weather modes and vcps.  When activated, the VCP and Mode Control window is
displayed.  It contains a collection of buttons to change the Auto PRF flag,
change, download, modify, and restart VCPs, toggle mode auto-switching, and
select the default weather mode and default vcp for each weather mode.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.  If any unsaved edits are detected
a warning popup window is displayed to give the user a chance to save them
before exiting.

A pair of radio buttons are provided to toggle on/off the Auto PRF flag.  If
Auto PRF is on, the "On" radio button is set.  The set color for the "On"
button is green.  If Auto PRF is off, the "Off" radio button is set.  The set
color for the "Off" button is yellow.  If the Auto PRF flag is on, and the RDA
control state is not local, a new VCP is downloaded to the RDA every volume
scan.  If the Auto PRF flag is off, new VCPs are not automatically downloaded.

When the VCP control task is started, VCP adaptation data are read to determine
the VCPs that are defined in the RPG.  Two sets of VCP control buttons are
provided: One to change to a local (RDA resident) VCP and the other to change
to a remote (RPG resident) VCP.  The VCPs in each set are grouped into three
categories; Precipitation, Clear Air, and Maintenance.  If the RDA control
state is local, all buttons in both sets are are desensitized.

CHANGE to RDA VCP
-----------------

VCP control buttons in the first container, "CHANGE to RDA VCP", are used to
command the RDA to use a local VCP pattern at the start of the next volume
scan.  If a local VCP pattern is in use, the button corresponding to the local
VCP is displayed with a white background.  Selecting any of these buttons
results in a verification popup window being displayed before a command is
issued to change VCPs.

DOWNLOAD VCP from RPG
---------------------

VCP buttons in the second container, "DOWNLOAD VCP from RPG", are used to
download an RPG resident VCP to the RDA and command it to use it at the start
of the next volume scan.  If a remote VCP pattern is in use, the button
corresponding o the remote VCP is displayed with a white background.  Selecting
any of these buttons results in a verification popup window being displayed
before a command is issued to change VCPs.

Modify Current VCP
------------------

The next row contains a "Modify Current VCP" button. Selecting this button
activates the "PRF Selection" task from which data corresponding to the
currently active VCP can be edited. Refer to the man page hci_prf(1) for more
information on the PRF Selection task.

Display VCP Adaptation Data
--------------------------

Selecting the "Display Adaptation" button activates the Display VCP Adaptation
Data window.  The Display VCP Adaptation Data window contains selections to
display the properties of all defined VCPs.

Inside the "VCP Selection" container are radio buttons for each defined
VCP.  Selecting one of these buttons controls which VCP is loaded into the
VCP table.  By default, the currently active VCP is selected and loaded.

Above the VCP table are two sets of radio buttons.  The first set, "Show"
is used to toggle between PRF number and unambiguous range (RMAX) in the
table.  By default, PRF number is selected and displayed in the table.  The
second set, "Velocity Increment" is used to toggle the velocity increment
adaptable parameter between low (1.94 nm) and high (0.97nm) resolution.  By
default, the button corresponding to the currently defined velocity increment
is set.

The VCP table consists entries for each cut defined in the selected VCP.  A
row entry consists of the cut number, associated elevation angle, scan rate
(in seconds), waveform type, azimuth and PRF number (or RMAX if selected) for
3 sectors, and signal to noise ratios for each of the 3 defined moments.

Selecting a PRF number button changes to PRF number to the next value defined
in the allowable PRF table for the VCP.  If the maximimum allowable PRF number
has already been reached, the value is changed to the minimum allowable PRF
number.  Sector azimuths must be defined in clockwise order.  Signal to noise
ratios are automatically rounded to the nearest 0.25 dB.

Restart VCP
-----------

Selecting the "Restart VCP" button restarts the currently active VCP from its
first scan number. The button first activates a confirmation popup window before
a command is issued.

Default Wx Mode
---------------

Selecting the "Default Wx Mode" button changes the default weather mode between
the two states, "Precipitation (A)" and "Clear Air (B)".  The default weather
mode state determines which VCP and product generation list will be used when
the RPG is started up.  When the "Default Wx Mode" button is selected, a
confirmation  popup window is displayed for verification.

Default VCP Mode A(B) 
---------------------

Selecting a VCP from the list of VCPs following the "Default VCP Mode A(B):"
label sets the default VCP for the corresponding weather mode when it is
detected.

Control Mode 
------------

In the "Control Mode" section are two sets of toggle buttons to define the 
auto-switching behavior of each mode. There is also a "Mode Status" button
that launches the hci_mode_status task.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header file "vcp.h" for
more information about VCP data structures.
