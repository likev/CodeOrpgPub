This file contains information about the HCI Alert Threshold Editor task.  It
is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed
rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores
and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Alert Threshold Editor task was created as a sub task in the HCI family of
tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the
"Alert/Threshold" pushbutton in the RPG Products submenu of the RPG
Control/Status task.  However, as a stand-alone application, it can be launched
from the command line using the "hci_alt" command or by invoking a system call
in any other application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a
number of benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task
(hci.doc).

The Alert/Threshold Editor task provides functionality provided by the "Alert
Threshold Edit Screen", the "Alert Threshold Values", and "Product Alert
Pairing" menus in the legacy UCP.  A full description can be found in the man
page hci_alt(1).

The Alert Threshold Editor window cannot be resized directly by the user.  It
is automatically resized to fit the number of entries in the selected alert
threshold group.

There is a requirement to restrict editing of alert threshold data to the URC
level user.  A valid password must be entered before any editing can be
performed.

An advisory lock is placed on the data message corresponding to the alert
threshold category message (ORPGALT_CATEGORY_MSG_ID) in the
ORPGDAT_ALERT_THRESHOLD linear buffer when the window is unlocked for editing.
If another instance of the task is running and unlocked, a warning popup is
displayed advising the user that the message is currently being edited by
another user.  When the  window is locked, the advisory lock is removed.

The alert threshold category and group information are read from the
configuration file "alert_table".

Currently, an additional copy of the alert threshold data is maintained to
support legacy algorithms.  Editing is done on the new data store and edits
are automatically converted and copied to the legacy data store.

The timer procedure is activated in 1/4 second intervals.  Its only function
is to raise the window to the top of the window heirarchy when a selection is
made from one of the paired product combo box menus (selecting a menu item
which extends outside the domain of the Alert Threshold Editor window causes
the focus to change to the window beneath the menu selection).

Testing
-------

To test this function fully one must have a narrowband user connected so that
paired products can be sent to them when a defined alert threshold value is
reached.  Otherwise, to just test the GUI, no external connections are
required.
