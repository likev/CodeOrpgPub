This file contains information about the HCI RDA Control/Status task.  It is
intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather
than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and
events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

All of the buttons which send commands to the RDA are desensitized when the
RDA/RPG wideband interface is not connected.  If the RDA/RPG wideband
interface is connected and the RDA is in local control, the only command
button which can be selected is the "Get Status" button (requests new RDA
status).

The RDA Control window cannot be resized.

A timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  The window is updated
after the RPG  or wideband state changes or after new RDA status data are
detected.

Testing
-------

To test the full thread, a fully operational RPG needs to be running and either
a live RDA connected or the RDA simulator running.  The test tool "wb_stat" can
be used to test the GUI response to various connect states.  The test tool
"rdastat" can be used to change various RDA status message elements and update
the RDA status message.
