SYNOPSIS

hci_cbm [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_cbm" command invokes the Clutter Bypass Map task for the RPG.
It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is
part of the Human-Computer Interface family (HCI) of tasks, typically launched
from the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can
be run as a stand-alone application from the command line.

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-iconic       Launch the task in an iconic state
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from

OVERVIEW

The Clutter Bypass Map task provides a graphical user interface to view
RPG clutter bypass map data.  Clutter bypass map data is stored at the RPG
as a message.  This "baseline" message contains a copy of the bypass map sent
from the RDA.  This message cannot be edited. When the RPG is first started up,
the message is initialized but cannot be displayed until a valid clutter
bypass map is received from the RDA.

When activated, the Clutter Bypass Map window is displayed.  The Clutter
Bypass Map window contains a set of control buttons at the top and a 
bypass map data display area.

Selecting the "Request" button results in a command being sent to the RDA
requesting new bypass map data.  When new bypass map data have been received
at the RPG, a message is written to the system status log and displayed by the
RPG Control/Status (refer to man page hci(1)) and RPG Status (refer to man
page hci_status(1)) tasks.

A set of radio buttons are provided between the control buttons and the
display region. The overlay grid can be turned "On" and "Off".

As the cursor is moved inside the display area, the relative position
(azimuth and range) from the radar is displayed in the upper left corner of
the display area.  Distance units are nautical miles.

The button to the right of the "Segment Number" label controls which segment
is displayed in the display region.  Currently there are up to five
segments which can be displayed.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header file "clutter.h"
for detailed information on clutter bypass data formats and message IDs.
