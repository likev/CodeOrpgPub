This file contains information about the HCI Clutter Bypass Map task.
It is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed
rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores
and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

*** NOTE NOTE NOTE ***
To support ORDA, two executables were added to this task. If hci_cbm determines
the RDA configuration to be ORDA, then hci_cbm calls hci_cbm_orda, if the RDA
configuration is legacy, then hci_cbm calls hci_cbm_legacy. The only difference
between the two executables are macro names (i.e. "under the hood" stuff) not
noticed by the user.
**********************

The Clutter Bypass Map task was created as a sub task in the HCI family
of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the "Bypass
Map Editor" icon pushbutton in the Applications region of the RPG Control/Status
window.  However, as a stand-alone application, it can be launched from the
command line using the "hci_cbm" command or by invoking a system call in any
other application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of
benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The Clutter Bypass Map task includes the clutter bypass map data
functionality provided by the legacy UCP "Clutter Bypass Filter Editor" menu.
A full description can be found in the man page hci_cbm(1).

The window can be resized.

In the ORPG, one clutter bypass map message is defined; the default clutter
bypass map.  The default clutter bypass map is not editable and contains
the latest clutter bypass map received at the RPG from the RDA. When the user
activates the task, the clutter bypass map message is loaded into the local
buffer and displayed. When the task is started, if the clutter bypass map
message hasn't been initialized, the default clutter bypass message is copied
to the clutter bypass map message. If not, as soon as clutter bypass map 
message is received at the RPG from the RDA, the default clutter bypass map
message is initialized by the new message.

The timer procedure is activated in 2 second intervals.  It checks to see
if the copy of the clutter bypass map has been initialized.  If not, it
checks for a valid default bypass map and updates the copy when one is
received and displays it.

Testing
-------

To test this function fully, a live RDA is needed.  However, the RDA simulator
can be used to test everything except where a new downloaded bypass map is
expected.
