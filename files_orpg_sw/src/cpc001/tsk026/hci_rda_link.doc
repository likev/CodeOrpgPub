hci_rda_link.doc		    NOTES		hci_rda_link.doc


This file contains information about the HCI RDA/RPG Interface Control/Status
task.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is
designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data
stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RDA/RPG Interface Control/Status task was created as a sub task in the HCI
family of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the
hot connection between the RDA and RPG containers in the RPG Control/Status
window.  However, as a stand-alone application, it can be launched from the
command line using the "hci_rda_link" command or by invoking a system call in
any other application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number
of benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The RDA/RPG Interface Control/Status task provides functionality provided by
the "UNIT CONTROL", "COMLINE CONNECTION", and "INTERFACE PARAMETERS" menus in
the legacy UCP.  A full description can be found in the man page 
hci_rda_link(1).

The RDA/RPG Interface Control Status window cannot be resized.

The Loopback Rate field is not editable when loopback testing is disables.

A timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  The window is updated
when a change is detected in the internal RDA status message (this message
includes both the wideband status and the latest RDA status message).

Testing
-------

To test the full thread, a fully operational RPG needs to be running and either
a live RDA connected or the RDA simulator running.  The test tool "wb_stat" can
be used to test the GUI response to various connect states.
