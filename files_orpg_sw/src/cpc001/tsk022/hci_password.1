SYNOPSIS

hci_password [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_password" command invokes the HCI Password Manager task for the
RPG.  It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It
is part of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks, typically
launched from the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However,
it can be run as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_password recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The HCI Password Manager task provides a graphical user interface to manage
HCI passwords. The window contains a set of radio buttons to select the user
level and a set of edit boxes to enter and change the password for the selected
user level  Currently the following user levels are defined: Agency, URC, and
ROC.  When a user level is selected, the first edit box, to the right of
the "Old Password" label, becomes editable.  If a valid password is entered for
that user level the edit box becomes uneditable and the edit box to the right
of the "New Password" label becomes editable.  After a new password is entered,
the edit box becomes uneditable and the edit box to the right of the "Verify
New Password" label becomes editable.  If the previously entered password is
reentered, a warning popup window is displayed indicating that the password has
been changed.  If the passwords don't match, a warning popup window is 
displayed indicating that an invalid password was entered.  In this case the
user will have to repeat the process to change the password.  Selecting the
"Close" button closes the Change Passwords window.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).
