hci_password.doc		    NOTES		   hci_password.doc


This file contains information about the HCI Password task.  It is intended
to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather than by a
typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events used by
this task is presented.

Design
------

The RPG Password task was created as a sub task in the HCI family of tasks.
A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the "HCI Password"
icon pushbutton in the HCI Misc window.

However, as stand-alone application, it can be launched from the command line
using the "hci_password" command or by invoking a system call in any other
application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of
benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

Testing
-------

To test this function, one needs to have the RPG running.  Any changes to font
passwords will apply to any HCI family task when it is restarted.  Password
changes apply immediately.
