NAME

hci_precip

SYNOPSIS

hci_precip [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_precip" command invokes the Precipitation Status task for the RPG.  It
is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is part
of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks, typically launched from
the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can be run
as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_precip recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The Precipitation Status task provides a graphical user interface to display
status from the precipitation detection algorithm and change adaptation data
used by the precipitation detection algorithm.  When activated, the
Precipitation Status window is displayed.  It consists of two control buttons
and various status information.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.  If any unsaved edits to the
precipitation detection adaptation data are detected, a warning popup window is
first displayed to allow the user to save the edits.

The status items in the Precipitation Status window are updated as soon as new
precipitation status data are written by the precipitation detection algorithm
with the exception of the "Time Until Clear Air" label.  This is updated at
the beginning of each volume scan.  The value is determined by subtracting the
time significant precipitation was last detected from the current volume time
and subtracting the result from 60 minutes.  If the result is negative, it is
set to 0.  Also displayed are the volume times the precipitation detection
algorithm was last executed, the current precipitation category, and the latest
volume times light and significant precipitation were detected.  The
precipitation categories are color coded as follows:

	NONE        (0) - Normal background color
	SIGNIFICANT (2) - Red background color
	LIGHT       (1) - Yellow background color

The current precipitation category is also displayed in the RPG Control/Status
window (refer to the man page hci(1)).  Status information generated by the
precipitation detection algorithm are displayed in tabular form in the bottom
half of the Precipitation Status window.  It is updated once per volume scan.
The exact time during the volume scan that it is updated depends on whether
significant precipitation is detected.  If it is, the status will be updated as
soon as the criteria for significant precipitation is met.  If not, then it
will be updated after the last elevation cut in the precipitation detection
adaptation data is checked.  Each line in the table represents an entry in
the precipitation detection adaptation data in which the specified criteria
was met.  If no criteria was met, the label "No Precipitation Detected" is
displayed in the table.

Modify Precipitation Detection Parameters
-----------------------------------------

Selecting the "Modify Parameters" button activates the Modify Precipitation
Detection Parameters window.  It consists of several sets of control buttons
and a table displaying precipitation detection adaptation data.  Since these
data are password protected, a lock icon button is displayed in the upper right
corner of the window.

Selecting the "Close" button closes the Modify Precipitation Detection
Parameters window.  If any unsaved edits are detected, the user is first
prompted about saving the edits.

The "Save" button is selectable when the window is unlocked and unsaved edits
are detected.  When selected, a confirmation popup window is first displayed.
An affirmative response results in the local edit buffer being written to
the edit (working) file.

The "Undo" button is selectable when the window is unlocked and unsaved edits
are detected.  When selected, all unsaved edits are discarded and the display
is refreshed to its pre-edit state.

Selecting the "Restore" button replaces the edit (working) copy of precipitation
detection adaptation data with baseline (backup) values.  A confirmation popup
window is first displayed for verification.  The window must be unlocked for
editing and no edits detected for this button to be selectable.

Selecting the "Update" button replaces the baseline (backup) copy of
precipitation detection adaptation data with edit (working) values.  A
confirmation popup window is first displayed for verification.  The window must
be unlocked for editing and no edits detected for this button to be selectable.

The "Add", "Modify", and "Delete" buttons in the "Edit" container are only
selectable when the window is unlocked for editing by the ROC level user.  The
"Modify" button is also selectable when the window is unlocked for editing by
the URC level user.

Selecting the "Add" button activates the Add Precipitation Table Item window.
It is used to add a new entry to the precipitation detection adaptation data
table.  Edit boxes are provided to define a range of elevation angles, the
precipitation rate threshold, the nominal clutter area, the precipitation area
threshold, and set the precipitation category for the new table item. 
Selecting the "Apply" button adds the new entry to the table and closes the
Add Precipitation Table Item window.  Selecting the "Close" button with
unapplied edits activates a warning popup window allowing the user one last
chance to apply the edits.

Selecting the "Modify" button activates the Modify Precipitation Table Item
window.  It is used to modify entries for the highlighted table item in the
Modify Precipitation Detection Parameters window (table row can be highlighted
by using the mouse to select an item in the row.  The highlighted row border
color is white).  If the edit level is URC, then the only field in the Modify
Precipitation Table Item window is nominal clutter area.  If the edit level
is ROC, then all fields in the Modify Precipitation Table Item window are
editable.  Selecting the "Apply" button updates the data and forces a refresh
in the Modify Precipitation Detection Parameters window.  Selecting the "Close"
button with unapplied edits activates a warning popup window allowing the user
one last chance to apply edits.

Selecting the "Delete" button deletes the currently highlighted entry from
the precipitation detection adaptation data table.  A warning popup window is
first displayed for verification.

Since the precipitation detection algorithm reads the precipitation detection
adaptation data at the beginning of each volume scan, any saved edits will not
take effect until the next volume scan.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header files "itc.h" and
"precip_detect.h" for information about precipitation detection status and
adaptation data structures.
