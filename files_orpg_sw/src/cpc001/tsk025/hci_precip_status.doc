hci_precip_status.doc		    NOTES		hci_precip_status.doc


This file contains information about the HCI Precipitation Status task.  It is
intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather
than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events
used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RPG Precipitation Status task was created as a sub task in the HCI family
of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the hot label
to the right of the "Precip Status:" label in the RPG Control/Status window.
However, as  stand-alone application, it can be launched from the command line
using the "hci_precip_status" command or by invoking a system call in any other
application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of
benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The Precipitation Status task consists of a main status window, called the
Precipitation Status window. It cannot be resized. 

A timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  The Precipitation
Status window is updated when the precipitation status message ID in the HCI LB 
is updated.

Testing
-------

To test the full thread, a fully operational RPG needs to be running and 
ingesting base data.

SOURCE FILES
