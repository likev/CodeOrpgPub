This file contains information about the HCI RDA Alarms task.  It is intended
to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather than by
a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events used
by this task is presented.

Design
------

*** NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE *******
For ORDA, two new tasks have been added. If the RDA configuration is legacy,
then hci_rda calls hci_rda_legacy. If the RDA configuration is ORDA, then
hci_rda calls hci_rda_orda. Task hci_rda simply determines the configuration
and calls the appropriate executable. For each executable, the information
below still applies.
*******************************

The RDA Alarms task provides new functionality not provided by the legacy UCP.
In the legacy UCP, RDA alarm data were written to the system status log along
with all other type messages.  In the ORPG, RDA alarm data are still written
to the RPG system log but also to the ORPGDAT_RDA_ALARMS linear buffer.  A
full description can be found in the man page  hci_rda(1).

The RDA Alarms window can be resized.  Horizontal and vertical scrollbars are
provided when the window is not large enough to display all of the data.

A timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  The window is updated
after the RPG state changes or after new RDA alarm data are detected.  The
RDA alarm messages are displayed in reverse chronological order.

Testing
-------

To test the full thread, a fully operational RPG needs to be running and either
a live RDA connected or the RDA simulator running.  The test tool "wb_stat" can
be used to test the GUI response to various connect states.  The test tool
"rda_alarm" can be used to set any of the RDA alarm codes.
