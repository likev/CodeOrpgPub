NAME

hci_pup_stat

SYNOPSIS

hci_pup_stat [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_pup_stat" command invokes the PUP/RPGOP Status task for the RPG.  It
is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is part
of the Human-Computer-Interface (HCI) family of tasks, typically launched from
the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can be run
as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_pup_stat recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The PUP/RPGOP Status task provides a graphical user interface to display the
current state and error status for all class 1 and RPGOP users.  When selected,
the PUP/RPGOP Status window is displayed.  It contains a button to exit the
task, a command status label, a table containing entries for all class 1 users, and
an error display area.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.

Each entry (row) in the table contains a status request button with the user
name and ID as the label, a state label, and an error status button.  Selecting
the status request button for a table entry causes a status request command to
be issued to that user.  A feedback label is displayed to the right of the
"Close" button.  When new status is received, the state and error status labels
are updated.  The state label can be one of the following:  "Unknown",
"Training", "Operational", or "Cmd Shutdown".  The error status labels are
color coded.  The possible error status labels are defined as follows:

	Unknown   (tan)   - Error status is unknown
	No Errors (green) - No errors were detected
	Errors    (red)   - Error were detected

If any errors were detected in the status message, the error status label
becomes sensitized.  Selecting the error status button causes an English
description of all errors defined in the status message to be displayed in the
error display area.  The following error messages can be defined:

	"No Errors"
	"Graphic Equipment"
	"Alphanumeric Terminal"
	"Archive Device No. 1"
	"Archive Device No. 2"
	"Streamer Tape"
	"Storage Disk No. 1"
	"Storage Disk No. 2"
	"Hardcopy Device"
	"Audible Alert Mechanism"
	"Narrowband Line 1 Failed"
	"Narrowband Line 2 Failed"
	"Narrowband Line 3 Failed"
	"Narrowband Line 4 Failed"
	"Narrowband Line 5 Failed"
	"Narrowband Line 6 Failed"
	"Narrowband Line 7 Failed"
	"Narrowband Line 8 Failed"
	"Narrowband Line 9 Failed"
	"Spare"

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header files for more information on how these data are stored.
