This file contains information about the HCI RPG Status task.  It is intended
to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather than by
a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events used by
this task is presented.

Design
------

The RPG Status task was created as a sub task in the HCI family of tasks.  A
typical user would normally activate it by selecting the "Status" pushbutton in
the RPG container of the RPG Control/Status window.  However, as a
stand-alone application, it can be launched from the command line using the
"hci_status" command or by invoking a system call in any other application
wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of benefits which
are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The RPG Status task provides functionality provided by the "RPG ALARMS" and
"SYSTEM STATUS" menus in the legacy UCP.  A full description can be found in
the man page hci_status(1).

The RPG Status window can be resized directly by the user.  Vertical scrollbars
are provided to navigate through the system log message and selected message
information lists.

The RPG Status task takes a considerable amount of time to start up.  This is
because of the number of label widgets defined in the System Log Messages
scrolled list (currently 1600).  This task could be improved significantly by
reducing the list size and adding a paging feature.  This would probably be
much better for low bandwidth configurations.  Also, under the current design,
if the system log LB contains over 1600 messages, only the latest 1600 can
be displayed.  If the paging capability was implemented, there would be no
limit to the number of messages that can be processed.

In the RPG Alarm Summary container the "Task Failure" object is a pushbutton.
Selecting it displays a popup window containing a list of all failed RPG
control tasks.  This information is published by the HCI Agent task (refer to
the doc file and man page for the "hci_agent" task).

The timer procedure is activated approximately every second.  The system status
objects are refreshed whenver any of the following conditions happen:

	RDA/RPG wideband status changes
	RPG state changes
	RPG mode changes
	RPG alarm state changes
	Weather mode changes
	Product distribution load shed info changes
	
The system log message list is updated by the timer procedure whenever a new
system log message is detected.

The failed task list is updated by the timer procedure whever the task info
has been updated and the Failed Task window is open.

Testing
-------

To test this function fully one should have the RPG running.
