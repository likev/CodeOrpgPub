This file contains information about the HCI PRF Selection (Modify Current VCP)
task.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is
designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data
stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The PRF Selection (Modify Current VCP) task was created as a sub task in the
HCI family of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting
the "PRF Selection" icon pushbutton in the Applications region of the RPG
Control/Status window.  However, as a stand-alone application, it can be
launched from the command line using the "hci_prf" command or by invoking a
system call in any other application wishing to launch it.  This modular
approach has a number of benefits which are described in the doc file for the
hci task (hci.doc).

The PRF Selection (Modify Current VCP) task provides the functionality provided
by the "Current Volume Coverage Pattern" menu in the legacy UCP.  Its purpose
is to allow the user to modify data for the current VCP so it can be 
downloaded to the RDA.  Whenever the VCP number changes, the data for the
current VCP is replaced by the adaptation data associated with the new VCP
number.  A full description can be found in the man page hci_prf(1).

The PRF Selection (Modify Current VCP) window cannot be resized.

The data in the obscuration table is updated whenever a sector definition is
changed or when new base reflectivity and obscuration products are loaded.
The data in the obscuration table represent the percentage of area tagged
as range folded in a given sector.  The PRF number which results in the least
amount of obscuration in each sector is displayed with reverse foreground
and background colors.  The background reflectivity product is defined in
the "hci_task_data" configuration file.  The "hci_agent" task initializes
the ORPGDAT_PRF_TASK_DATA_MSG_ID in the ORPGDAT_HCI_DATA LB with the default
product codes for low and high bandwidth configurations.  The PRF Selection
task reads this message and loads the product corresponding to the current
bandwidth mode.

When sectors are defined with the mouse, te clockwise rule of ordering is
preserved.

When the left mouse button is pressed inside a sector the PRF number is
incremented by 1.  If the new PRF number is larger than the maximum allowed
(as defined in RDA adaptation data for each VCP), it is set to the smallest
allowable PRF number.

When the right mouse button is pressed inside a sector the PRF number is
decremented by 1.  If the new PRF number is smaller than the minimum allowed
(as defined in RDA adaptation data for each VCP), it is set to the largest
allowable PRF number.

The user can manually set sector and signal to noise ratio values directly
by editing the table in the Modify Current VCP Adaptation Data window.  Only
table changes to the lowest elevation angle are reflected in the graphical
display.

The PRF Selection (Modify Current VCP) task is not selectable from the RPG
Control/Status window when VCP 31 is active (since only one PRF number is
allowed).  However, it can be activated from the command line regardless of
the active VCP number.

The timer procedure is activated in 2 second intervals.  All PRF Selection
windows are updated if the current VCP data store has been updated.  If the
VCP number has changed, then a warning popup is displayed informing the user
to restart the application.

Testing
-------

To test this function fully, a live RDA is required so that the new VCP data
can be downloaded and verified at the RDA.  The RDA simulator can be used to
test the GUI.

To test the background product feature one should run the task in both low
and high bandwidth modes and define different products as the defaults in the
"hci_task_data" configuration file.
