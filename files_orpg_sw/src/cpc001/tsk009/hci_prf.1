NAME

hci_prf

SYNOPSIS

hci_prf [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_prf" command invokes the PRF Selection (Modify Current VCP) task for
the RPG.  It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.
It is part of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks, typically
launched from the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However,
it can be run as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_prf recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The PRF Selection (Modify Current VCP) task provides a graphical user interface
to modify the characteristics of the currently active VCP.  The characteristics
which can be edited include: Velocity interval, sector azimuth and PRF number,
and signal/noise ratio.  When activated, the "PRF Selection (Modify Current
VCP) window is displayed.  It consists of several sets of control buttons, an
obscuration table and a data display/edit region.

Control Buttons
---------------

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.  If any unsaved edits to the
current VCP data are detected, a warning popup window is first displayed to
give the user a chance to save the edits.

The "Save" button is desensitized until edits are made.  Selecting it causes
edits to be written to the data store containing the current VCP data.  A
warning popup window is first displayed for verification.

The "Undo" button is desensitized until edits are made.  When unsaved edits
are present, selecting it discards all unsaved edits and restores the window
to its pre-edit state.

Selecting the "Download" button commands the RDA control task to download the
current VCP data to the RDA.  A warning popup window is first displayed for
verification.  If unsaved edits are detected, a warning popup window is
displayed indicating that edits will be saved if the download procedure is
continued.  If the auto PRF flag is enabled, another warning popup window
is displayed giving the user a chance to disable it before the download.

Selecting the "Refresh" button causes the base reflectivity and obscuration
data inside the display/edit region to be updated with the latest available.

Selecting the "0.97 kts" and "1.94 kts" radio buttons to the right of the 
"Velocity Increment" label change the Doppler velocity resolution in the
current edit session.

The two buttons embedded in the label "Modify elevations in range...." define
the range of elevations affected by edits made in the display/edit region.
Selecting a button changes the label to the angle of the next elevation cut
in the VCP, wrapping around to the first cut it the last cut was reached.  The
elevation of the first button will always be less than or equal to the second
button.  Selecting the first button while the labels for both buttons are the
same causes the label angles to increment equally for both buttons.

Obscuration Table
-----------------

Displayed just above the display/edit region is a table containing a set of
labels and buttons for each allowable PRF number in the current VCP.  Each
PRF number constitutes a row in the table.  Labels are provided indicating the
unambiguous range and nyquist velocity for each PRF number.  Buttons are
provided with labels indicating the percentage of area within each and all
sectors where data was detected but velocities are indeterminate for each PRF
number.  The PRF number with the least obscuration is displayed with a white
background for each and all sectors.  Selecting one of the table buttons
changes the PRF number of the corresponding sector and results in an update to
the data displayed in the display/edit region.

Data Display/Edit Region
------------------------

Data displayed in the display/edit region consist of a composite of a base 
reflectivity product and obscuration data output by the automatic PRF selection
algorithm.  The base reflectivity product is defined in the "hci_task_data"
configuration file.  Entries for both high and low bandwidth configurations
are defined.  Data are combined so that, using the PRF number for a given
sector in the current VCP, an element in the base reflectivity product which
is flagged as obscured in the obscuration product is colored "purple".  The
sector boundaries and sector PRF numbers defined for the lowest elevation cut
in the current VCP are overlaid.  The attribute information (date, time, site,
etc.) from the reflectivity product is displayed to the right of the
obscuration table.

As the cursor is moved inside the display/edit region, its relative position
from the radar is displayed in the upper left corner.  If the cursor is
located within 2 degrees of a sector boundary its shape changes from a pointer
to a hand.  Pressing the left mouse button and dragging the mouse while the
cursor shape is a hand will move the sector boundary.  Releasing the left mouse
button will change the sector boundary in the edit buffer.  Data in the
display/edit region and obscuration table are redisplayed using the new sector
information.

If the left mouse button is pressed and released while the cursor is located
more than 2 degrees from a sector boundary, the PRF number for the sector
containing the cursor will increment by 1 and the data in the display/edit
region will be redisplayed.  If the maximum allowable PRF number has been
reached, the sector PRF number is changed to the minimum allowable PRF number. 

If the right mouse button is pressed and released while the cursor is located
more than 2 degrees from a sector boundary, the PRF number for the sector
containing the cursor will decrement by 1 and the data in the display/edit
region will be redisplayed.  If the minimum allowable PRF number has been 
reached, the sector PRF number is changed to the maximum allowable PRF number.

There may be times when important reflectivity/obscuration information is
hidden by PRF sector labels.  The "On" and "Off" buttons to the right of the
"Label" label turns labels in the display/edit region on and off, respectively.
The current label overlay state corresponds to the button with the white
background color.

The "On" and "Off" buttons to the right of the "Table" label opens and closes
the Modify Current VCP Adaptation Data window.  This window contains a tabular
display of the current VCP data identical to the table displayed by the
Modify VCP Adaptation Data task (refer to the man page hci_vcp(1)).  The table
contains a set of buttons and edit boxes for each editable element of the
current VCP.  This table can be used to change sector azimuths, PRF numbers,
the velocity increment, and  signal/noise ratios for each cut in the current
VCP.  If this table is displayed while sector azimuth/PRF number changes are
made in the display/edit region, the table is updated.  It should be noted
that PRF number and sector azimuth changes made directly to the table only
affect the item changed whereas changes made in the display/edit region affect
all cuts within the defined elevation range.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header files "itc.h" and
"vcp.h" for more information on VCP data structures.
