NAME

hci_spp

SYNOPSIS

hci_spp [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_spp" command invokes the Selectable Product Parameters task for the
RPG.  It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It
is part of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks, typically
launched from the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However,
it can be run as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_spp recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The Selectable Product Parameters task provides a graphical user interface to
display and edit RPG selectable product parameter adaptation data.  When
activated, the Edit Selectable Product Parameters window is displayed.  It
consists of several sets of control buttons and edit boxes.  Since selectable
product parameter adaptation data are password protected, a lock icon button
is displayed in the upper right corner of the window.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.  If any unsaved edits are detected
a warning popup window is first displayed to give the user a chance to save the
edits.

The "Save" and "Undo" buttons are desensitized until the window is unlocked for
editing and edits have been made.

Selecting the "Restore" button replaces the current selectable product 
parameter adaptation data with baseline (backup) values.  A warning popup
window is first displayed for verification.  The window must be unlocked for
editing for this button to be selectable.

Selecting the "Update" button replaces the baseline (backup) selectable product
parameter adaptation data with current values.  A warning popup window is
first displayed for verification.  The window must be unlocked for editing for
this button to be selectable.

Below the top row of control buttons are a set of radio buttons.  These buttons
define which selectable product parameters category is displayed.  These
buttons can be selected regardless of the edit state.  The following categories
are defined:

	Cell Product
	Layer Product
	OHP/THP Data Levels
	RCM Product
	RCM Reflectivity Data Levels
	STP Data Levels
	VAD and RCM Heights
	Velocity Data Levels

When a category is selected, a table is displayed containing a list of parameter
names, min and max values, current value, and units.  If the window is unlocked
for editing, the current category fields are editable (unless otherwise noted).

When the "Cell Product" radio button is selected, the Cell Product Parameters
table is displayed.  The following parameters are defined.

	  Parameter Name		   min       max   value   units
	+-------------------------------+--------+-------+-------+-----------+

	+-------------------------------+--------+-------+-------+-----------+
								
When the "Layer Product" radio button is selected, the Cell Product Parameters
table is displayed.  The following parameters are defined.

	  Parameter Name		   min       max   value   units
	+-------------------------------+--------+-------+-------+----------+
	| Layer 0 Height                |      0 |    52 |     0 |  kft     |

	| Range Limit                   |     40 |   460 |   460 |  km      |
	+-------------------------------+--------+-------+-------+----------+

The Layer 0 Height parameter should be no lower than the first thousand foot
level above the radar.  Thus, the value of this parameter will vary from site
to site.
	
When the "RCM Product" radio button is selected, the RCM Product Parameters
table is displayed.  The following parameters are defined.

	  Parameter Name		   min       max   value   units

	| Product Generation Time 2     |      0 |    59 |    50 |  mins    |
	+-------------------------------+--------+-------+-------+----------+

In addition, check boxes are displayed below the table to restrict RCM product
generation for class IV users, RCM product generation times (RCM product can
be generated up to twice per hour).  A drop down menu is also provided to
select the PUP (or class 1 user) allowed to edit the RCM.

Levels with VAD defined are denoted by "V" and levels with RCM defined are
denoted by "R".

When the "Velocity Data Levels" radio button is selected, the Velocity Data
Levels table is displayed.  This table consists of 8 components, with one
component being displayed at a time.  Eight radio buttons are defined, one

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header files "orpgadpt.h"
and "product_parameters.h" for more information on selectable product
parameters data structures and how to access these data.
