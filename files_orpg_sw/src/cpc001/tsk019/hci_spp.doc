This file contains information about the HCI Edit Selectable Product Parameters
task.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is
designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about
data stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Edit Selectale Product Parameters task was created as a sub task in the
HCI family of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting
the "Selectable Parameters" pushbutton in the RPG Products sub window of the
RPG Control/Status task.  However, as a stand-alone application, it can be
launched from the command line using the "hci_spp" command or by invoking
a system call in any other application wishing to launch it.  This modular
approach has a number of benefits which are described in the doc file for
the hci task (hci.doc).

The Edit Selectable Product Parameters task includes the selectable product
parameters functionality provided by the legacy UCP "SELECTION OF PRODUCT
PARAMETERS", "LAYER PRODUCT PARAMETERS", "RCM PRODUCT PARAMETERS",
RCM REFLECTIVITY DATA LEVEL CODE SELECT", "VAD AND RCM HEIGHT SELECTIONS",
VELOCITY DATA LEVEL CODE SELECT", "STP DATA LEVELS", "OHP/THP DATA LEVELS",
and "CELL PRODUCT PARAMETERS" menus.  A full description can be found in the
man page hci_spp(1).

All data contained in the table are read from RPG adaptation data.  Although
specific category items are hard coded, the contents for each category are
dynamically read from adaptation data.  The data includes, item description,
min and max values, units, and current value.  Range checking is done both
in the application and by the adaptation data API.

There is a requirement to restrict editing of the selectable product parameters
data to the URC level user.  Editable fields are desensitized until the window
is unlocked with a valid password.

The window cannot be resized directly by the user.  The window size changes
automatically when a new category is selected.  The window is resized so that
the data for the new category are visible.

An advisory lock is placed on the data corresponding to the category currently
being edited using the ORPGADPT_lock function.  If another instance of the task
is running and the user attempts to unlock the same list for editing, a warning
popup is displayed indicating the list is being edited by another user.  When a
different list is selected or if the window is locked, the advisory lock is
removed.

The timer procedure is activated in 1/2 second intervals.  It doesn't do
anything other than to check the state of the raise flag.  The raise flag is
set when an item from a combo box menu is selected.  When the flag is set, the
timer procedure raises the Edit Selectable Product Parameters window to the
top of the window heirarchy.  If this isn't done, the if the selected item
happens to lie outside the domain of the Edit Selectable Product Parameters
window, the underlying window is raised to the top.

Testing
-------

To test this function the RPG must be running.  SOme mechanism is needed to
verify product parameter changes in resultant RPG products.  This can be done
using the XPDT tool or by sending products to a PUP or its equivalent.
