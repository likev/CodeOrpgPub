NAME

hci - RPG Control/Staus Task

SYNOPSIS

hci [options] 

DESCRIPTION 

The "hci" command invokes the RPG Control/Status task for the RPG.  This is 
the primary task in the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks.  It
is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  All other
HCI family tasks can be invoked through this task.

OPTIONS

hci recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-iconic       Launch the task in an iconic state
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      RPG data stores.
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate
		
OVERVIEW

The "hci" task should be the launching point for all primary RPG HCI family
tasks.  It provides a graphical representation of the current state of the
WSR-88D along with sets of pushbuttons and "hot spots" to activate various
RPG functions and tasks.  As the user navigates the cursor over the RPG
Control/Status window, the cursor changes shape as it passes over selectable
and non-selectable objects.  The cursor changes shape to a hand whenever it
is moved over a selectable object (a pushbutton or "hot spot") and a pointer
as it moves over non-selectable objects.  The selectability of some objects
will change dynamically based on the current RPG state.  A selectable object
is activated (selected) by pressing the left mouse button with the cursor
(hand shaped) over it.

When invoked, the "hci" task displays a single window, hereafter referred
to as the RPG Control/Status Window.  Below is a pictorial representation
of the RPG Control/Status Window and its major objects.  Each objects is
explained in more detail.

==============================================================================

The RPG Control/Status Window is divided into two regions:  The "Control/Status"
region and "Applications" region.

The "Control/Status" region contains a graphical representation of the WSR-88D.
It contains a set of objects representing 3 main WSR-88D components:  RDA, RPG,
and User.  A timer procedure is invoked every half second and various RPG
state information is read.  If changes are detected, a resize procedure is
invoked which updates all objects in the RPG Control/Status window.  Most of
the labels in the window use scalable fonts such that their sizes are based
on the size of the window.
 
The RPG Control/Status window can be resized by moving the cursor to one of
the window corners, pressing the left mouse button, and dragging the mouse.
There is a minimum window width and height allowed in order to preserve the
integrity of the graphical objects displayed in the window.  When resizing
the window, the width or height may be automatically adjusted to preserve a
minimum width/height ratio..

RDA Container
-------------

The RDA container is represented by a collection of graphical objects in the
left third of the Control/Status region.  The focal point is a rectangular box
with the label "RDA" at the top.  Inside are two buttons:  Control and Alarms.

Selecting the Control button activates the RDA Control/Status Window from which
the user can send various control commands to the RDA.  If the RDA is in local
control, most of the buttons in this window are inactive; their appearance is
fuzzy.  If the RDA is in remote control, or if it is neither in local or remote
control, all of the buttons are active; their appearance is sharp.  Selected
RDA status information is displayed in the bottom portion of the window.  If
the RDA/RPG wideband connection has failed, status information is left blank.
If the site is configured as FAA redundant or if spot blanking is installed,
a lock button is displayed in the upper right corner of the window.  A valid
password is required to enable/disable spot blanking and for redundant
channel control.

Selecting the Alarms button activates the RDA Alarms Window from which the user
can review a history of RDA alarms.  An alarm entry consists of a date/time,
the RDA device associated with the alarm, the type of alarm, the alarm code,
and an readable description of the alarm (as defined in the RDA/RPG ICD).
NOTE: The date/time stamp is generated at the RDA so it may not match the 
date/time at the RPG!  A number of filters are provided for the user to control
the types of RDA alarms which are displayed.  The user can filter by RDA
device, description, and date/time.

Power
-----

To the left of the RDA control box is a graphical representation of the RDA
power source.  It can either be utility (a set of power poles) or auxiliary
(a building with a fuel tank next to it).  If the power source is auxiliary,
a request for new RDA performance data is sent at the beginning of each new
volume scan so that the generator fuel level can be updated in the fuel tank
graphic.  If the RDA/RPG wideband link is connected, the power source graphic
can be selected in order to change the power source.  If the RDA/RPG wideband
link is not connected, the power source graphic is blank and not selectable.

Tower, Radome, TPS
------------------

Above the RDA control box is a graphic of the tower and radome.  If TPS is
installed, the TPS status is displayed inside the tower graphic.  The TPS
state can be either "OFF" (red) or "OK" (green).  The inside of the radome is
used to display the azmuthal and elevation positions of the latest radar data
available to the RPG algorithms.  The elevation angle  is displayed numerically
at the center of the radome.  The azimuthal position is represented by a black
ring which is drawn at the outer edge of the radome.  The azimuth position can
be determined by locating the last drawn part of the ring and treating the
radome as a compass (north at the top).  The ring is cleared at the start of a
new elevation scan.

VCP Info
--------

To the right of the radome are a set of black lines representing the elevation
cuts in the currently active VCP.  The active cut is displayed as yellow.  The
VCP number is displayed over the lines along with an indicator if a remote/local
pattern (R/L) is being used and what the current weather mode is (A/B/M).  
Selecting this label will activate the VCP Control task.  Refer to the man page
hci_vcp(1) for more information about the VCP Control task. Beneath the VCP 
info are the date and time of the start of the current volume scan along with
the volume number.

Current Date/Time
-----------------

At the top of the window (above the radome and VCP graphics) is a label
displaying the RPG number and the current RPG system date/time.  It is
updated every fourth timer interval (currently ~2 seconds).

Volume Info
-----------

Beneath the VCP graphic is a label displaying the current volume number and
its corresponding start date and time (RDA time).  It will change at the
start of each new volume scan.

RDA Alarms
----------

To the left of the radome and tower are 3-character labels indicating active
RDA alarms by RDA device (up to 8 alarms in legacy RDA, 7 in ORDA).  An RDA
status message contains an element consisting of a set of bits representing
each RDA device.  If a bit is set, then it indicates the associated RDA device
has an active alarm.  If no labels are displayed, then no RDA alarms are active.
Selecting one of these labels activates the RDA Alarms window and filters only
for the device corresponding to the label. Refer to man page hci_rda(1) for
information about the RDA Alarms task.

Archive Base Data
-----------------

Beneath the RPG container is a button labeled ArchiveII LDM Data.  Selecting
this button activates the Archive II Status window.  i
The Archive II window contains buttons to start/stop archive II.
Archive II status can be one of the following:  "Not Active", "Active", "Unknown", "Error".

RDA/RPG Link
------------

Between the RDA and RPG containers is a graphic indicating the state of the
RDA/RPG interface.  If the interface is connected, a set of 3 horizontal bars
are displayed connecting the RDA and RPG containers; one for each moment.  If
a moment is enabled, the color of the bar is green.  If a moment is disabled
the bar is white.  If data for a moment is currently being ingested, a black
block is moved repeatedly between the RDA and RPG containers along the bar.

If the RDA/RPG interface is disconnected, the bars are replaced with a label.
If the RDA/RPG interface is not connected, the following states are defined:
"Not Implemented", "Connect Pending", "Disconnect Pending", "Disconnect HCI",
"Disconnect CM", "Disconnect SHUTDOWN", "Down", "Failure", and "Unknown".

Moving the cursor over the RDA/RPG interface graphic causes the cursor to 
change to a hand indicating the object is selectable.  Selecting it activates
the RDA/RPG Interface Control/Status window.  Refer to the hci_rda_link(1) man
page for more details.

RDA Ctl State
-------------

Between the RDA tower and RPG container object is a line and label indicating 
the RDA control state.  The label can be blank (meaning the RDA control state
is unknown) or one of the following:

	RDA     - Local control
	RPG     - Remote control
	EITHER  - Either has control
	
If the RDA/RPG wideband link is not connected, no line or label are displayed.

MLOS
----

For sites supporting MLOS an additional button is displayed to the right of
the RDA tower graphic.  Selecting this button activates the MLOS Status task.
Refer to the man page hci_mlos(1) for more information in the MLOS Status task.

RPG Container
-------------

The RPG container is represented by a control box with the label "RPG" at the
top.  Inside are three or four buttons, depending on the site configuration.
For non-RMS sites, the following buttons are defined:  "Control", "Products",
and "Status".  For RMS sites, an "RMS" button is also defined.

The RPG container will be displayed in red whenever an active RPG alarm is
detected.  The "Status" button can be selected to determine which RPG alarm(s)
is(are) active.  Refer to the man page for hci_status(1) for more information
on RPG Status.

Selecting the "Control" button activates the RPG Control window.  From it the
user can shutdown/startup RPG tasks and change operational modes.  Refer to 
the man page for hci_rpc(1) for more information on RPG Control.

Selecting the "Products" button activates the RPG Products window.  The RPG
Products window contains selections to modify Alert/Threshold adaptation data,
Product Generation lists, Load Shed Products adaptation data, Selectable
Product Parameters adaptation data, Algorithm adaptation data, and display the
contents of the RPG Products Database.  Refer to the man page for hci_alt(1)
for more information on modifying Alert/Threshold adaptation data, hci_prod(1)
for information on modifying Product Generation lists, hci_prod_priority(1) for
information on modifying Product Priorities, hci_spp(1) for information on
modifying Selectable Product Parameters adaptation data, hci_adapt(1) for
information on modifying Algorithm adaptation data, and hci_pstat(1) for
information on displaying the contents of the RPG Products Database.

For RMS sites, selecting the "RMS" button activates the RMS Messages window.
If the RMS interface is down, the RMS button is displayed in red.  The RMS
messages window contains selections to inhibit RMS and to send free text
messages to the RMS.

If any RPG alarms are set, one or more two character labels are displayed
to the left of the RPG container.  These alarms are categorized as maintenance
mandatory ("MM"), maintenance required ("MR"), and load shed ("LS").  Refer
to the man page hci_status(1) for more information on these types of alarms.

RPG State
---------

Above the RPG container is a color coded label representing the RPG state.
The following RPG states and associated colors are defined:

	OPERATE    (green)
	TRANSITION (yellow)
	SHUTDOWN   (red)
	STANDBY    (red)
	FAILED     (red)
	POWERFAIL  (red)
	UNKNOWN    (red)
	
The "TRANSITION" state will occur while the RPG is changing from one state to
another (i.e., SHUTDOWN to OPERATE).

RPG Mode
--------

Above the RPG container is a color coded label representing the RPG mode.
The following RPG modes and associated colors are defined:

	OPERATE    (green)
	TEST (RDA) (yellow)
	TEST (RPG) (yellow)
	UNKNOWN    (red)
	
The "TEST (RDA)" mode will occur when the RPG is indirectly commanded to test
mode as a result of the RDA going to maintenance mode.  The "TEST (RPG)" mode
will occur when the RPG operator explicitly commands the RPG to test mode.

RPG/USERS Link
--------------

Between the RPG and USERS containers is a graphic indicating the state of the
narrowband interface.  If the RPG is in an OPERATE state, then a bar is
displayed between the RPG and USERS containers.  If the RPG mode is OPERATE
the bar is green with a black block moving along the bar.  If the RPG mode is
TEST (RDA) or TEST (RPG), the bar is white and the data block red (not moving).
If the RPG is not in an OPERATE state, no connection is displayed between the
RPG and USERS containers.  

If the RPG is in an Operate state, selecting the bar activates the Product
Distribution Comms Status task.  Refer to the man page hci_nb(1) for more
information about the Product distribution Comms Status task.

If the site is configured as FAA redundant, the state of the comms relay box
is displayed above the bar.  The possible comms relay states are: "Assigned",
"Unassigned", and "Unknown".

USERS Container
---------------

The USERS container is represented by a control box with the label "USERS" at
the top.  Inside are three buttons:  "Comms", "Products", and "Status". 

Selecting the "Comms" button activates the Product Distribution Comms Status
window.  Refer to the man page hci_nb(1) for more information about the

Beneath the USERS and to the right of the Archive Products containers is a
block of color coded labels containing various state information.  Depending
on the RPG state, moving the cursor over any state label in this block will 
change the shape to a hand, indicating that the label is selectable.  The
following state information are presented: "Precip Cat", "VAD Update",
"PRF Mode", "Load Shed", "Audio Alarms", and "RDA Messages".

The "Precip Status" item displays the current precipitation status as determined
by the precipitation detection algorithm.  The possible states are:

	ACCUM    - Accumulating precipitation
	NO ACCUM - Not accumulating precipitation

Selecting the precipitation status label activates the Precipitation Status
window.  Refer to the man page hci_precip_status(1) for more information about
the Precipitation Status task.

	DISABLED - RDA messages are inhibited (red).
	
Selecting the inhibit RDA messages flag label toggles between the two states.
If enabled, RDA alarm and status messages are displayed in the Status and 
Alarms lines of the RPG Control/Status window.  If disabled, RDA alarm and 
status messages are not displayed in the Status and Alarm lines of the RPG
Control/Status window.

Applications
------------

The Applications container contains a collection of icon buttons which are used
to activate various ORPG functions.  The following functions are activated from
this container:

	Base Data Display
	Clutter Regions
	Bypass Map Editor
	PRF Control
	RDA Performance Data
	Console Messages
	Environmental Data
	HCI Properties
	
All of these functions consist of independent tasks with the exception of the
Console Messages function which is part of the RPG Control/Status task.  The
Console messages window is automatically popped up upon receipt of an RDA 
console or free text message.  The Console Messages window provides an
interface to send messages to and display messages  sent from external users.
The Console Messages window can be manually activated by selecting the
"Console Messages" button.

The "Base Data Display" button activates the Base Data display task.  It
provides an interface to display dealiased radial data used as input to RPG
algorithms.  Refer to the man page hci_basedata(1) for more information on the
Base Data Display task.

The "Clutter Regions" button activates the Clutter Suppression Regions Editor
task.  It provides an interface to display/edit clutter suppression regions
data which are used by the RDA.  Refer to the man page hci_ccz(1) for more
information on the Clutter Regions Editor task.

The "Bypass Map Editor" button activates the Clutter Bypass Map Editor task.

task.

Feedback-Status-Alarms
----------------------

At the bottom of the RPG Control/Status window are three single line blocks
preceded by the labels "Feedback", "Status", and "Alarms".  These blocks
contain descriptive English strings.

The "Feedback" block contains a single descriptive string indicating an
action performed by an HCI task.  Actions which cause a feedback string to be
generated include: RDA control, RPG control, saving edits, restoring and
updating data stores, requesting data, and downloading data.

The "Status" block contains the latest non-alarm message written to the system
]status log.  If no status messages have been written to the log in five
minutes, the message "No System Status Change in last 5 minutes" is displayed
(not written to system status log).  The background color for status messages
are usually in the normal background color.  However, status messages which
have been tagged internally as GL_ERROR will be displayed in yellow.  GL_ERROR
type messages are usually generated by an RPG task when some invalid condition
is detected but not considered severe.  If the "RDA Messages" state label is
"DISABLED", no new RDA status messages will be displayed (they will still be
written to the system status log).

The "Alarms" block contains the latest alarm message written to the system
status log.  The background color can be either red or green.  Red indicates
an alarm activated message was written to the system log file.  Green indicates
an alarm cleared message was written to the system log file.  If the "RDA 
Messages" state label is "DISABLED", no new RDA alarm messages will be
displayed (they will still be written to the system status log).

Both status and alarm type messages are displayed with a date/time stamp 
indicating when the message was generated at the RPG.

Bld Info
--------

In the lower right corner of the RPG Control/Status window is a label which
displays the build number and date for the task.  It is assumed that the
task will be built the same time as all other ORPG tasks.  The date label
is automatically generated when the build is made.  The build number is
manually updated by the build master (macro RPG_BUILD_VERSION in the global
header file orpg.h).  The build number contains a major and one digit minor
number.


FAA Configurations
------------------

FAA sites may be configured as redundant and/or RMS.  If RMS is configured, an
additional button is added in the RPG container.  If the button is red, the RMS
interface is down.  Selecting the RMS button activates the RMS Messages window.

If the site is configured as FAA Redundant, additional control/status items are
added to the RPG Control/Status window.  The State/Control block contains
an additional item named "Adapt Times".  If the associated label is "MATCH"
(green), the adaptation data update time field in the status message for the
local and redundant channels match.  If the associated label is "MISMATCH" 
(red), the update time field in the status message for the local and redundant
channels do not match.  

Channel control/status is added to the RDA Control/Status window for FAA 
Redundant sites.  Refer to the man page hci_rdc(1) for more  information on RDA
Control/Status.  Two new RPG alarms are added to the RPG Status window.  Refer
to the man page hci_status(1) for more information on RPG Status.  The
communications relay state information is added above the bar between the RPG
and USERS containers.  The state can be one of the following:  "ASSIGNED", 
"UNASSIGNED", or "UNKNOWN".  All HCI window titles contain the label "FAA:x" 
where "x" is the channel number. The RPG Control/Status and RDA Control/Status
windows also contain the RPG state.  The RPG state can be one of the following:
"ACTIVE", "INACTIVE", or "UNKNOWN".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE:  It is assumed that the hci command is to be run in a normal ORPG
environment.  Various data stores (linear buffers) are expected to be properly
initialized.
