This file contains information about the HCI Agent task.  It is intended to be
used by those interested in how the software is designed rather than by a
typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events used by
this task is presented.

Design
------

The Agent task was created as a sub task in the HCI family of tasks.  It is
run as an RPG control task providing support to other HCI family tasks.  It
does not have a user interface like the other HCI family tasks.  Its primary
purpose is to monitor various RPG data stores and publish information which
can be used by other RPG (specifically HCI) tasks.  It also is responsible for
initializing and maintaining product support data for the Clutter Regions
Editor and PRF Selection tasks.

One of the functions of the HCI Agent task is to monitor changes to the RPG
task table and publish a list of failed tasks.  The RPG task table is a fairly
large file and would require significant bandwidth to read from low bandwidth
sites.  The failed task list can be viewed from the RPG Status task (refer to
the man page hci_status(1)).

Another HCI Agent function is to monitor changes to the RPG system status log
and publish the latest status and alarm messages.  This is especially useful
to the RPG Control/Status task when it is run at low bandwidth sites.

At startup, the HCI Agent task checks for the existence of the 
HCI_CCZ_TASK_DATA_MSG_ID and HCI_PRF_TASK_DATA_MSG_ID messages in the
ORPGDAT_HCI_DATA LB.  If they do not exist, they are initialized from the
"hci_task_data" configuration file.  These messages contain information about
products which are required to support the display of background products
in the Clutter Regions Editor and PRF Selection tasks.  The HCI Agent task
reads these messages and builds and sends an RPS list to the ORPGDAT_RT_REQUEST
LB at startup or whenever it detects a change to the aforementioned data
messages.  Since a line index is required, the HCI Agent uses line 0.  IT IS 
MPORTANT THAT LINE 0 IS NOT USED BY ANY NARROWBAND USER!

Testing
-------

To test this function, one needs to have the RPG running.  The HCI RPG Status
and RPG Control/Status windows should be open.  As new system log messages are
generated, one should veriy that the latest status and alarm messages are
displayed at the bottom of the RPG Control/Status window.  The RPG Status
window will contain a display of all messages for verification.  One can test
the failed task functionality by killing an RPG control task and then verifying
with the RPG Status task that the "Failed Tasks" label is red and that the
Failed Task list contains the killed task.

To test the background product support function one should use the
"prod_stat -p" command to verify that the products defined in the Clutter
Regions Editor and PRF Selection tasks configuration data are scheduled for
generation.
