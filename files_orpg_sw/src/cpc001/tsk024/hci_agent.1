NAME

hci_agent

SYNOPSIS

hci_agent [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_agent" command invokes the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) agent task
for the  ORPG.  It is a non-GUI application which should be run along with
other RPG control tasks.  Its primary purpose is to handle high-bandwidth
operations for other HCI tasks and produce low-bandwidth output.  Unlike other
HCI family tasks, hci_agent should be run on the ORPG platform instead of the
MSCF platform.

OPTIONS

hci_agent recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
OVERVIEW

The HCI Agent task is an RPG control task which runs on the RPG computer.  Its
primary purpose is to monitor changes to designated ORPG data files and write
summary information which can be used by other HCI family tasks.  This task is
especially important for distant configurations where bandwidth is severely
limited.

The tasks performed by the HCI agent include: Manage failed task table, 
Manage latest RPG status and alarm messages, and check for changes to the
Clutter Regions Editor task (see hci_ccz(1)) and PRF Selection task (see
hci_prf(1)) configuration data.

The ORPG task table is a fairly large file which would pose a problem for any
remote low-bandwidth HCI task needing to read it regularly.  The HCI agent
reads this file when notified of updates and produces a summary file containing
the name and ID of all failed tasks.  The HCI RPG Status task (see
hci_status(1)) provides a popup window to display this information to the
operator.

The RPG status log file is another large file which would pose a problem for
any remote low-bandwidth HCI task needing to read it regularly.  The HCI agent
reads the file whenever notified of updates and produces a summary file
containing the latest alarm and status (non-alarm) messages.  The latest
status and alarm messages are stored for the HCI RPG Control/Status task (see
hci(1) so it will not have to read the entire system log file at task
startup in order to determine the latest status and alarm messages.

The Clutter Regions Editor and PRF Selection tasks require certain background
products to be generated.  These products are defined in the configuration
file "hci_task_data" and maintained in the HCI_CCZ_TASK_DATA_MSG_ID and
HCI_PRF_TASK_DATA_MSG_ID messages in the ORPGDAT_HCI_DATA LB.  It is the
responsibility of the HCI agent task to initialize these messages (if they
don't exist) and monitor changes to them.  At task startup, or when one of the
data stores are updated, the HCI agent task builds an RPS list and sends it to
the ORPGDAT_RT_REQUEST LB.  This RPS list contains the products required by
the Clutter Regions Editor and PRF Selection tasks.  Line 0 is used for the
request since it isn't used by any narrowband configuration.

In FAA RMS configurations, the HCI Agent task monitors changes in RMS status.
Whenever it changes, the RMS status message is updated in the HCI data LB so
other HCI applications can access this information.
