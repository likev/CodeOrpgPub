This file contains information about the HCI RPG Control task.  It is intended
to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather than by
a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events used
by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RPG Control task was created as a sub task in the HCI family of tasks.  A
typical user would normally activate it by selecting the "Control" pushbutton
in the RPG container in the RPG Control/Status window.  However, as a
stand-alone application, it can be launched from the command line using the
"hci_rdc" command or by invoking a system call in any other application
wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of benefits which
are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The RPG Control task provides functionality provided by the "UNIT CONTROL"
menu in the legacy UCP.  A full description can be found in the man page 
hci_rpc(1).

The RPG Control window cannot be resized.

The specific command issued when the Restart "All Tasks" pushbutton is
selected depends on the RPG state at that time.  If the RPG state is
"SHUTDOWN", a startup command is issued, otherwise a restart command is
issued.

Selecting the "Options" pushbutton activates the RPG Options window.  The
contents of this window are defined by the contents of the "rpg_options"
configuration file.  Changes to this file do not require the RPG to be
shutdown and restarted.  Only the RPG Control task needs to be restarted.

A timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  The window is updated
when the RPG state or mode changes.

Testing
-------

To test the full thread, a fully operational RPG needs to be running and either
a live RDA connected or the RDA simulator running.
