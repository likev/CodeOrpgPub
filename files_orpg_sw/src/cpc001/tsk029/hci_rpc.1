NAME

hci_rpc

SYNOPSIS

hci_rpc [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_rpc" command invokes the stand-alone RPG Control task for for the RPG.
It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is
part of the Human-Computer Interface family (HCI) of tasks, functionally 
identical to the RPG Control function in the RPG Control/Status task (refer to
man page hci(1)).  It can be run as a stand-alone application from the command
line.

OPTIONS

hci_rpc recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The RPG Control task provides a graphical user interface to change the state of
the RPG.  When activated, the RPG Control window is displayed.  It contains a
collection of buttons and status labels.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.

If the local configuration supports RMS, a check box with the label "Lock RMS"
is displayed just to the right of the "Close" button.  If this check box is
set, RPG control commands from the RMS are disabled.

At the top of the window are two color-coded status labels indicating the RPG
operational state and mode.  The following RPG operational states are defined:

	OPERATE    (green)
	STANDBY    (red)
	SHUTDOWN   (red)
	TRANSITION (yellow)
	FAILED     (red)
	POWERFAIL  (red)
	UNKNOWN    (red)

The transition state occurs when the RPG is changing between the other states.
If the RPG Control/Status window is open, identical operational state
information is displayed above the RPG container (refer to the man page 
hci(1)).

The following RPG modes are defined:

	OPERATE    (green)
	TEST (RDA) (yellow)
	TEST (RPG) (yellow)
	UNKNOWN    (red)
	
There are two test modes defined, "TEST (RDA)" and "TEST (RPG)".  The "TEST
(RDA)" mode occurs when the RPG goes into test mode as a result of the RDA
going to maintenance mode.  In this mode, if the RDA goes to operate mode, the
RPG will automatically go back to operate ("OPERATE") mode.  The "TEST (RPG)"
mode occurs as a result of the RPG operator commanding the RPG to test mode.
If the RDA control state is remote, then the RPG will command the RDA into
maintenance mode.  If the RPG Control/Status window is open, identical
operational mode information is displayed above the RPG container (refer to
the man page hci(1)).

Restart
-------

Selecting the "All Tasks" button starts all non-HCI RPG tasks.  A confirmation
popup window is displayed for verification.  If the RPG is currently in an
"Operate" state, selecting the "All Tasks" button issues a restart command.
This causes the RPG to go to a standby state and then back to operate.  If the
RPG is currently in a "Standby" state, selecting the "All Tasks" button issues
a restart command.  If the RPG is currently in a "Shutdown" state, selecting
the "All Tasks" button issues a startup command.

Selecting the "Options" button activates the RPG Init Options window.  It
contains a set of buttons and a list of check boxes with which the user can
perform various initialization procedures.  These procedures are defined in a
special configuration file named "rpg_options" (refer to the man page
rpg_options(4) for more information).  Setting and activating any of these
initialization options require a password.  A lock button is provided for
unlocking the window.  When a valid password has been entered and the RPG is
in a state defined for a configuration option, the check box for the option
is sensitized.  Selecting the "Activate" button activates all selected init
options.  A confirmation popup window is first displayed.

Shutdown
--------

Selecting the "Off" button stops all non-HCI RPG tasks and puts the RPG in a
shutdown state.  A confirmation popup window is displayed for verification.
While tasks are being shutdown, the RPG state is reported as "TRANSITION".
Once all tasks are shutdown, the RPG state is reported as "SHUTDOWN".  When the
RPG is started from a shutdown state, all non-persistent RPG data stores are
reinitialized.  NOTE:  The "Shutdown" button can be selected when the RPG state
is "STANDBY" so that when the RPG is started, non-persistent data stores will
be reinitialized.

Selecting the "Standby" button stops all non-HCI RPG tasks and puts the RPG in
a standby state.  A confirmation popup window is displayed for verification.
While tasks are being shutdown, the RPG state is reported as "TRANSITION".
Once all tasks are shutdown, the RPG state is reported as "STANDBY".  When the
RPG is started from a standby state, RPG non-persistent RPG data stores are not
reinitialized.  NOTE:  The "Standby" button can be selected when the RPG state
is "SHUTDOWN" so that when the RPG is restarted, non-persistent data stores
will not be reinitialized.

Mode
----

Selecting the "Operate" button changes the RPG mode from test to operate.  If
the current RPG mode is "OPERATE", the "Operate" button is desensitized.  If
the current RPG mode is "TEST (RPG)", selecting the "Operate" button will
change the RPG mode to "OPERATE" only if the RDA is in operate mode or if the
RDA control state is remote and an operational VCP is active.  If the RDA is
running a maintenance VCP, the RPG cannot go to operate.  If the RPG mode is
"TEST (RPG)", selecting the "Operate" button will change the RPG mode to
"TEST (RDA)" as long as a maintenance VCP is in use.  As soon as an operational
VCP is active and the RDA operational mode is operate, the RPG mode will
automatically change to "OPERATE".  When the "Operate" button is selected, a
confirmation popup window is displayed for verification.

Selecting the "Test" button changes the RPG mode from operate to test
("TEST (RPG)").  If the current RPG mode is "TEST (RPG)", the "Test" button is
desensitized.  If the current RPG mode is "TEST (RDA)" the "Test" button is
sensitized.  Selecting it at this time will change the RPG mode to "TEST (RPG)".
When the "Test" button is selected, a confirmation popup window is displayed
for verification.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header file "mrpg.h" for
more information on RPG states and modes.
