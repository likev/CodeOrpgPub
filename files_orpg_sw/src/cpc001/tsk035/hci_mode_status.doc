This file contains information about the HCI Mode Status task.  It is
intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather
than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events
used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RPG Mode Status task was created as a sub task in the HCI family
of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the "Mode
Status" button in the "VCP and Mode Control" (tsk 007) gui window.
However, as a stand-alone application, it can be launched from the command line
using the "hci_mode_status" command or by invoking a system call in any other
application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of
benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The Mode Status task consists of a main status window, called the
Mode Status window, and a child window called Modify Mode Detection Parameters.
The Modify Mode Detection Parameters window provides a user interface to edit
mode detection adaptation data.

There is a requirement to restrict editing of the mode detection
adaptation data to the URC and ROC level users. Editable 
fields are desensitized until the window is unlocked with a valid password.

All Mode Status windows cannot be resized.  Vertical scrollbars are
provided whenever too many table items exist to be visible.

The "Time Until Clear Air" value is managed internally.  The value is determined
by taking the difference between the current volume time and the time
precipitation was last detected and subtracting the result from 60
minutes.  If the value is negative, it is displayed as 0.

A timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  The Mode
Status window is updated when the mode status data is updated.
The Modify Mode Detection Parameters window is updated after
the mode detection adaptation data are updated.

Testing
-------

To test the full thread, a fully operational RPG needs to be running and 
ingesting base data.
