NAME

hci_prod

SYNOPSIS

hci_prod [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_prod" command invokes the RPG Product Generation Table Editor task for
the RPG.  It is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.
It is part of the Human-Computer Interface (HCI) family of tasks, typically
launched from the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However,
it can be run as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_prod recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      ORPG data stores.

	-iconic	      start in an iconic state
	
	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate

OVERVIEW

The RPG Product Generation Table Editor task provides a graphical user 
interface to display and edit current and default product generation lists.
When activated, the RPG Product Generation Table Editor window is displayed.
It contains a set of control buttons and a scrolled table of all products that
are defined by the RPG.

Selecting the "Close" button exits the task.  If any unsaved edits are detected
a warning popup window is first displayed to give the user one last change to
save the edits.

The "Save" and "Undo" buttons are desensitized until edits are detected.
Selecting "Save" writes the edit buffer to one of the product generation list
data stores.  A warning popup window is first displayed for verification.
Selecting "Undo" discards all unsaved edits and causes the edit buffer to be
reread.

The "Current", "Precip (A)", "Clear Air (B)", and "Maintenance" radio buttons
at the top of the window control which product generation list is displayed.
If one of the default tables is selected ("Precip (A)", "Clear Air (B)", or
"Maintenance"), a lock icon is displayed in the upper right corner of the
window since these lists are password protected.  To edit any of the default
tables the user must first select a password level and enter a valid password.
By default the "Current" radio button is set indicating that the current
product generation list is displayed.

When the current product generation list is active, a set of radio buttons are
available for replacing the current product generation list with one of the
default product generation lists.  These buttons are not displayed when one of
the default product generation lists are active.

A number of filter options are available for controlling the product generation
list display.  A search edit box is available for entering in a search pattern.
Only products with the search pattern (case insensitive) in their descriptions
are displayed.  Three additional options are provided for the user to control
the order the products are displayed in the table.  The "Product Code" radio
button is set by default.  When this button is set, products are displayed in
order of increasing product code.  Note:  Products with product codes less than
16 are not displayed in the list except for the ROC level user, where all
products are displayed.  The "Product MNE" sort button sorts the products by
mnemonic.  The "Description" sort button sorts the products alphabetically by
description.

If one of the default product generation lists are being edited, the "Restore"
and "Update" buttons are displayed.  Selecting the "Restore" button replaces
the current default product generation list with its baseline copy.  A warning
popup window is first displayed for verification.  Selecting the "Update"
button replaces the baseline default product generation list with the current
copy.  A warning popup window is first displayed for verification.

The product generation list table consists of one entry per product that is
defined in the product attributes table.  For non ROC level users only products
with product codes of 16 or larger are displayed.  An entry consists of an
uneditable mnemonic, product code, and description and editable generation
interval, archive interval, storage interval, product database retention time,
and elevation/cut (for elevation based products).  Table entries with a 
generation interval of zero are not defined in the product generation list.

There are several ways to add a product to the selected generation list.
The first way is to change the generation interval to 1.  The other fields
are set to the following default values: archive interval 0, storage interval
1, retention time 30, and elevation/cuts -1 (if the product is elevation based).

The second way to add a product to the selected generation list is to change
the archive interval to a non-zero value.  If the archive interval is set
to a positive integer, it represents the frequency (in volumes) in which the
product is archived.  The other fields are set to the following default
values: generation interval 1, storage interval 1, retention time 1, and
elevation/cuts -1 (if product is elevation based).  If the archive interval is
set to a negative integer, it represents a cuts value (the lowest X cuts will
be archive for each volume scan).  The other fields are set to the following
default values: generation interval 1, storage interval 1, retention time 30,
and elevation cuts to the archive value (if the product is elevation based).

The third way to add a product to the selected generation list is to change
the elevation/cuts value (only if the product is elevation based).  A negative
integer is interpreted as a cuts value.  A positive or floating point value
is interpreted as an elevation.  The other fields are set to the following
default values: generation interval 1, archive interval 0, storage interval 1,
and retention time 30.

To delete a product from the selected generation list change the generation
interval to "0".  All other entry elements are set to "0".

The archive interval can be interpreted as either a frequency or a cuts value.
If the value is positive, it is interpreted as a frequency.  The product will
only be archived at that frequency.  If the value is negative (for elevation
based products only), it is interpreted as a cuts value.  In this case the
elevation/cuts field must be defined as a cuts value equal to or larger than
the archive cuts value.

The storage interval can be set to either 0 (not stored) or 1 (stored every
volume scan).  This field can only be defined when the generation interval
is 1.

The retention time can only be changed when the storage interval is 1.  The
value must fall within the range 30 to 360 minutes.

The elevation/cuts field only applies to elevation based products.  If the
value is positive or a floating point value, it is treated as an elevation
angle.  If the archive interval is defined as a cuts value, the elevation/cuts
field must be negative and have an absolute value equal to or greater than
the absolute value of the archive cuts value.  If the archive interval is
defined as a frequency, the elevation/cuts value can represent ether an
elevation angle or a cuts value.

When an entry for a product is selected, the border around all of the entry
fields is changed to white.  If a selected entry has additional parameters
defined, these parameters are displayed below the list.  If the window is
unlocked for editing, these parameters are editable.

When the current product generation list is edited and saved, changes will not
take effect until the next volume scan.

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header files "orpgpat.h",
"orpgpgt.h", and "prod_distri_info.h" for more information on internal
formats.
