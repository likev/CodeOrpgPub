This file contains information about the HCI Product Generation Table Editor
task.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is
designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about
data stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Product Generation Table Editor task was created as a sub task in the
HCI family of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting
the "Generation List" pushbutton in the RPG Products sub window of the RPG
Control/Status task.  However, as a stand-alone application, it can be
launched from the command line using the "hci_prod" command or by invoking
a system call in any other application wishing to launch it.  This modular
approach has a number of benefits which are described in the doc file for
the hci task (hci.doc).

The Product Generation Table Editor task includes the product generation
functionality provided by the legacy UCP "Adaptation Generation and
Distribution Control" and "Generation and Distribution Control" menus.  The
window consists of several sets of control/filter buttons at the top and a
table containing product generation data.  A full description can be found in
the man page hci_prod(1).

All products contained in the table are read from product definitions found
in the product attributes table.  Refer to the man page product_tables(4)
for more information on the product attributes table.  The table also contains
the default product generation list.

There is a requirement to restrict editing of the default product generation
lists to the ROC level user.  When one of the default product generation lists
is selected, editable fields are desensitized until the window is unlocked
with a valid password.

The window can be resized only in the vertical dimension.  The window cannot
be made smaller than the size at which it is first created.

An advisory lock is placed on the data message corresponding to the list
currently being edited.  If another instance of the task is running and the
user attempts to unlock the same list for editing, a warning popup is displayed
indicating the list is being edited by another user.  When a different list is
selected or if the window is locked, the advisory lock is removed.

The timer procedure is activated in 1/4 second intervals.  It doesn't do
anything other than allow window updates to occur.

Testing
-------

To test this function the RPG must be running.
