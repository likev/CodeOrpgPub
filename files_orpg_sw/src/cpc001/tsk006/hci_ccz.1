NAME

hci_ccz

SYNOPSIS

hci_ccz [options]

DESCRIPTION

The "hci_ccz" command invokes the Clutter Regions Editor task for the RPG. It
is a GUI based task which runs in an X Windows/Motif environment.  It is part
of the Human-Computer Interface family (HCI) of tasks, typically  launched from
the RPG Control/Status task (refer to man page hci(1)).  However, it can be run
as a stand-alone application from the command line.

OPTIONS

hci_ccz recognizes the following options:

	-h	      print usage message and exit
	
	-iconic       Launch the task in an iconic state
	
	-l	      low bandwidth mode; compress data passed to/from
		      RPG data stores.

	-m <name>     RPG computer name
	
	-name <title> Window title
	
	-s <rate>     Set the simulated baud rate
	
OVERVIEW

**** NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE ****

While both the legacy RDA and ORDA are being supported, temporary design
changes have been implemented. There are now three executables. The main
executable (hci_ccz) determines what the RDA configuration is. Once determined,
hci_ccz calls either hci_ccz_legacy (for the legacy RDA) or hci_ccz_orda (for
the ORDA configuration). The legacy version is described below. The ORDA version
is similar, except that ORDA no longer has multiple clutter suppression
channels (surveillance and doppler). Instead, there is only one clutter
suppression channel.

*******************************************

The hci_ccz task provides a graphical user interface to view and edit RPG
Clutter Suppression Regions data.  The RPG clutter suppression regions data
store holds up to 20 separate clutter suppression regions files.  A clutter
suppression regions file can contain up to 15 regions.  There is always at
least one clutter suppression regions file defined.  This file, named
"Default", cannot be changed.  However, it can be used as a template, edited,
and saved as a different file.  The RPG maintains two copies of the clutter
suppression regions data: a working copy and a backup (baseline) copy.  All
edits are made to the working copy.

When activated, the Clutter Regions window is displayed.  The window title,
"Clutter Regions", also contains the name of the currently active file and the
date/time it was last modified.  By default, the "Default" file is displayed.

The Clutter Regions window consists of the following components: A set of file
control buttons, a display/edit area, a display control area, and a clutter
regions table.  Since clutter suppression regions data are password protected,
a lock icon button is displayed in the upper right corner of the Clutter 
Regions window.  By default, the "Restore" and "Update" buttons in the main
window are locked as well as the "Save" and "Delete" buttons in the Clutter
Region Files window.  To unlock the windows the user selects the lock icon
button to activate the Password window.  From this window the user selects
the password level and enters a password.


File Control
------------

The file control buttons are displayed at the top of the window.  Selecting the
"Close" button exits the task.  If any unsaved edits are detected when the
"Close" button is selected, a warning popup window is displayed allowing the
user a last chance to save them.

The "File" button actives the Clutter Region Files window.  This window
contains a set of buttons and a list of clutter suppression regions files.  To
open a file for display/edit select (double click) on a list entry.  A list
entry contains a file label and the date/time it was last updated.  The default
file should have a date/time of all zeros. If the Clutter Regions window has
been unlocked for editing, the "Delete" button in the Clutter Region Files
window is sensitized.  If edits have been made the "Save" button is also
sensitized.

If the "New" button is selected, a blank filename is displayed in the window
title and two regions are defined; one for each segment.  The regions are
identical with bypass map defined as the select code with high and medium
filtering for the Doppler and surveillance channels, respectively.  If the
"Save" button is subsequently selected, a popup window is displayed for
the user to specify a filename.  Canceling the save operation will result
in the loss of any user defined regions and the default file being loaded
and displayed.

If the "Save As" buttons are selected, a popup window is displayed for the
user to specify a new filename.  If the filename is already used, a warning
popup is displayed informing the user to choose a different name.

The "Undo" button discards all edits made to the current file and restores
the display to the pre-edit state.

The "Download" button is used to download the currently selected clutter
suppressions regions file to the RDA.  When selected, a warning popup is
displayed from which the user can continue with or cancel the download.  If
accepted, a download command is written to a message which is read by the
Control RDA task, formatted into the proper ICD format, and sent to the RDA.
If the RPG Control/Status window is open, the message "Downloading new Clutter
Censor Zones" is displayed in the feedback line and "Clutter Censor Zones
Received" is displayed in the status line.

The "Restore" button replaces the current (working) clutter suppression regions
files data with baseline (backup) values.

The "Update" button replaces the baseline (backup) clutter suppression regions
files data with current (working) values.

Display/Edit Area
-----------------

The display/edit area is broken up into two parts: a clutter regions edit
area and a composite bypass map area.  The clutter regions edit area is where
the user can define new clutter regions using the mouse.  Region overlays
are displayed over either a base reflectivity product or a CFC product.  The
CFC product is typically used to verify clutter regions which were sent to
the RDA.  The base reflectivity product is defined in the "hci_task_data"
configuration file (residing in the "$ORPGDIR/cfg" directory). 

As the cursor is moved over the clutter regions edit area, its relative 
position from the radar (azimuth and range) is displayed in the upper left
corner.  By default, range units are in nautical miles.  The "Km" and "NM"
radio buttons beneath the composite bypass map area are used to toggle the
units between kilometers and nautical miles.  Initially, clutter region
boundaries for the low segment are displayed over a 0.5 degree base
reflectivity product (if one is available).  The "Reflectivity" and "CFC"
radio buttons below the clutter regions edit area can be used to switch between
a base reflectivity product background and clutter filter control product (CFC) 
background.

The composite bypass map area contains a graphical representation of the
clutter bypass map data defined in the current file; one each for the 
surveillance and Doppler channels.  Color codes are assigned to the various
filters.  For overlapping boundaries, the highest priority filter is displayed.
The main purpose of the composite displays are to give the user an idea of how
the resultant clutter suppression regions data will look as a whole.  It may
help the user decide which regions are unnecessary in the case of overlapping
regions.

Display Control
---------------

The "Low" and "High" radio buttons to the right of the "Segment" label are used
to define which clutter suppression regions segment is used for display and
editing.  There are two choices as to which type of background product is
displayed with the sector data.  The first radio button corresponds to a
user defined radial product.  The full name of the product is displayed to
the right of the radio button.  The product can be changed by selecting an
item from the "Change Background Product" menu displayed when the radio button
is selected.  The contents of the menu are built from the contents of the
"hci_task_data" configuration file.  A default product is defined for both
the low and high bandwidth configurations.  The software will automatically
determine which configuration the user is currently editing in and change
the appropriate item.  Selecting a new product from the list forces the
generation of this product in subsequent volume scans (until the product is
changed).  If the product selected is currently being generated then it will
be immediately displayed.  If not, it won't be available until the next
volume scan.  The user should select the low or high segment buttons to
force a redisplay when the product becomes available.  When the low segment
radio button is selected the product corresponding to the lowest cut below
1.5 degrees is displayed.  When the high segment radio button is selected
the product corresponding to the lowest cut above 1.5 and below 4.5 degrees
is displayed.  When no product is available then the string "Background
Product Data Not Available" is displayed.  If the product can be found in the
product database but the time of the latest product is more than 15 minutes
old the string "Background Product Data Expired" is displayed.

If the "CFC" radio button is set, the user can choose which CFC channel is
displayed.  The CFC product will correspond to the "Segment" radio button which
is set.

The "Zoom" and "Sector" radio buttons to the right of the "Mode" label define
the actions of the mouse buttons when the cursor is inside the clutter regions
edit area.  If "Zoom" is set, the mouse is in zoom mode.  When in zoom mode,
selecting any button recenters the display with the selected location moved to
the clutter regions edit area.  Selecting the left mouse button also increases
the magnification by a factor of 2 (maximum magnification is 32:1).  Selecting
the right mouse button decreases the magnification by a factor of 1/2 (minimum
magnification is 1:1).  Increasing the magnification makes it easier to
define small-scale regions close to the radar.  If "Sector" is set, the mouse
is in sector mode.  When in sector mode, the user can define new regions by
selecting a sector corner, dragging the cursor to the opposite corner, and
then releasing the button.  An entry for each new region is added to the
clutter regions table.


Clutter Regions Table
---------------------

The clutter regions table displays textually, the properties of all defined
clutter suppression regions in the currently selected segment.  The user can
edit these properties directly.  Any changes to the table will be reflected
in the data displayed in the display/edit area.  The user can select a table
entry (clutter suppression region) by selecting a button in the "Region"
column.  This makes the entry active so if the "Delete" button above the table
is selected, that region is deleted from the table and display/edit area.

To create a new region, move the cursor into the clutter regions edit area.
Move the cursor to one of the sector corners of the new region, press the left
mouse button, drag the mouse until the cursor is at the opposite sector corner,
and then release the button.  The new sector is added to the clutter regions
table.  The default select code is "Bypass Map" and the notch widths are "Low"
for both channels.  You can change the select code and notch widths by
selecting the buttons.  The select code buttons will toggle between "Bypass 
Map", "All Bins" and "None". The notch width buttons will toggle between "Low",
"Medium", and "High" when the select code is either "Bypass Map" or "All Bins".

NOTES

In FAA redundant configurations, the label "(FAA:x)" is appended to the window
title ("x" is the RDA channel number).  Refer to the header file "clutter.h"
for detailed information on clutter suppression regions formats and IDs.
