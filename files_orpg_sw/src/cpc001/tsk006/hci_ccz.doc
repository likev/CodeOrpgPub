This file contains information about the HCI Clutter Suppression Regions Editor
task.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is
designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data
stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

**** NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE ****

While both the legacy RDA and ORDA are being supported, temporary design
changes have been implemented. There are now three executables. The main
executable (hci_ccz) determines what the RDA configuration is. Once determined,
hci_ccz calls either hci_ccz_legacy (for the legacy RDA) or hci_ccz_orda (for
the ORDA configuration). The legacy version is described below. The ORDA version
is similar, except that ORDA no longer has multiple clutter suppression
channels (surveillance and doppler). Instead, there is only one clutter
suppression channel.

*******************************************


The Clutter Suppression Regions Editor task was created as a sub task in the
HCI family of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting
the "Clutter Regions icon pushbutton in the Applications region of the RPG
Control/Status  window.  However, as a stand-alone application, it can be
launched from the command line using the "hci_ccz" command or by invoking a
system call in any other application wishing to launch it.  This modular
approach has a number of benefits which are described in the doc file for the
hci task (hci.doc).

The Clutter Suppression Regions Editor task includes the clutter suppression
regions data functionality provided by the legacy UCP "Clutter Suppression
Regions" menu.  A full description can be found in the man page hci_ccz(1).

In the ORPG an up to 32 character file label (including null terminator) has
been added to the clutter suppression regions data message for each file.  This
allows the user to tag each file for better reference.  The maximum number of
allowable clutter suppression regions files has remained 20.  In the ORPG,
only one "Default" file is defined.  This contrasts with the legacy RPG where
4 default files were defined.

The window cannot be resized.

There no longer is a requirement (Open build 2) to restrict editing and
downloading to URC and ROC level users.  However, in order to modify existing
files (using the "Save" button) or delete them the user must specify a valid
a valid URC or ROC level password.

The "Default" file cannot be edited but can be used as a template to create
a new file (use the "Save As" function).  The "Default" file cannot be deleted.

Selecting the "New" button currently is the same as selecting the default
file as a template and editing it.

An advisory lock is placed on the data message corresponding to the clutter
suppression regions message (LBID_CENSOR_ZONES_LGCY or LBID_CENSOR_ZONES_ORDA)
in the ORPGDAT_CLUTTERMAP
linear buffer when the window is unlocked for editing.  If another instance of
the task is running and unlocked, a warning popup is displayed advising the
user that the message is currently being edited by another user.

The biggest enhancement to the clutter suppression regions functionality in
the ORPG has been the capability to interactively define clutter suppression
regions over a background reflectivity product.  Since the purpose of this
function is to allow users to define regions containing non-meteorological
targets so different filtering can be applied, displaying a background
reflectivity product is a neccessity.

Also, when multiple regions are defined, it is useful to know what the
composite clutter filter map will look like; epsecially where regions overlap.
To the right of the base product display are color-coded composite maps for
the surveillance and Doppler channels.

A change in ORPG build 2 has been the capability to select the type of
background radial product to display.  Although one would typically expect
reflectivity based radial products as the background, most RPG products are
allowed (ones which are supported in the hci_decode_product.c module).  The
list of allowed background products are defined in the "hci_task_data"
configuration file in the "$ORPGDIR/cfg" directory.  The "n_products" key
is followed by the number of defined background products.  The "products" key
is followed by a list of "n_product" product codes.  If new background
products are added in the future they should be added to the configuration
file.  Of course if a new product code is added to the RPG then the product
decoder (hci_decode_product.c) and color header file (hci_product_colors.h)
must be updated to support it.  The Clutter Regions Editor task reads the
HCI_CCZ_RASK_DATA_MSG_ID message in the ORPGDAT_HCI_DATA LB for its background
product configuration data.

Upon startup, "hci_agent" task reads the "hci_task_data" configuration file
if the message HCI_CCZ_TASK_DATA_MSG_ID in the ORPGDAT_HCI_DATA LB doesn't
exist.  Using the definitions found for the "hci_ccz" entry in the
configuration file the HCI_CCZ_TASK_DATA_MSG_ID message is built.  The
product list is read in by the Clutter Regions Editor task and is presented
as a drop down menu in the Clutter Regions Editor window.  When an item is
selected from the menu, the message HCI_CCZ_TASK_DATA_MSG_ID is updated in
the ORPGDAT_HCI_DATA data store.  If the Clutter Regions Editor is running
in a high bandwidth configuration, the default high bandwidth product entry
is updated.  If it is running in a low bandwidth configuration, the default
low bandwidth product entry is updated.

The "hci_agent" task is registered for updates from the ORPGDAT_HCI_DATA LB.
When it detects a change to the HCI_CCZ_TASK_DATA_MSG_ID message it builds a
new RPS list and sends it to the ORPGDAT_RT_REQUEST LB for the "ps_routine"
task to handle.  The HCI uses 0 as the line index for the RPS list since it
is not used by any narrowband configuration.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT FUTURE ORPG
NARROWBAND CONFIGURATIONS DO NOT USE LINE 0.

In addition to the base reflectivity background display, the capability was
added to display the Clutter Filter Control (CFC) product instead of the
base reflectivity product.  This feature allows the user to compare the
clutter suppression regions he/she defined with those actually being used at
the RDA.  After a user defines clutter regions, saves them, and downloads them,
they should be available at the start of the next volume scan.  The new CFC
product will be built at the RPG after the RDA sends a new notchwidth map to
the RPG.

Testing
-------

To fully test the Clutter Suppression Regions Editor task one should be
connected to a live RDA.  This is beacause one needs to be able to download
new clutter regions to the RDA and get a new notchwidth map from the RDA so
the resultant CFC product can be used to verify the clutter regions data that
were defined.

To test the background product select function one needs a level II data feed.
In a clean install the HCI agent task will builld an RPS list from the
configuration file.  The "lelb_mon ps_routine" command can be used to validate
that an RPS list was received from line 0 and that the default low and high
bandwidth products are scheduled for generation.  The "prod_stat -p" command
can also be used to verify that the selected product has been requested and
scheduled.

Data should be available for display for the low segment selection after the
low cut is complete and for the high segment when the ~2.5 degree cut
is complete.  The display does not automatically update when the new products
are available.  The user must select the low or high segment radio buttons to
force a display update.

When selecting a new product from the list, if the selected product is already
defined in the current product generation list, then it can be displayed
immediately.  If not, then you need to wait until the next volume scan.

If the latest product available is older than 15 minutes, then the message
"Background Product Data Expired" is displayed instead of the product.  To
test this you can wait until a product is generated and displayed.  Then,
stop the level II data input for 10-15 minutes and then restart the data
stream.  When a new volume is started select the low or high radio buttons.
The message should be dipslayed instead of the product.  When the low elevation
cut has completed, reselect the low radio button.  The product should now be
available.  Select the high radio button again.  The product will not be
available until the ~2.5 degree cut has completed.
