This file contains information about the HCI Load Shed Categories task.  It
is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed
rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores
and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Load Shed Categories task was created as a sub task in the HCI family of
tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the hot label
to the right of the "Load Shed" label in the RPG Control/Status window.
However, as a stand-alone application, it can be launched from the command
line using the "hci_load" command or by invoking a system call in any other
application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of
benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The Load Shed Categories task provides functionality provided by the "Load
Shed Categories" menu in the legacy UCP.  A full description can be found in
the man page hci_load(1).

The Alert Threshold Editor window cannot be resized.

There is a requirement to restrict editing of load shed category data to the
ROC level user.  A valid password must be entered before any editing can be
performed.

An advisory lock is placed on the data message corresponding to the load shed
threshold message (LOAD_SHED_THRESHOLD_MSG_ID) in the ORPGDAT_LOAD_SHED_CAT
linear buffer when the window is unlocked for editing.  If another instance of
the task is running and unlocked, a warning popup is displayed advising the
user that the message is currently being edited by another user.  When the
window is locked, the advisory lock is removed.

Updates to load shed data displayed in the Load Shed Categories window are
not done while the window is unlocked for editing.

The timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  It checks for updates
to load shed data and also check the archive III status.  If the window is
unlocked for editing, no updates will be allowed.  If the window is locked,
window updates are allowed when the data are updated.  If the archive III disk
is not mounted or archive III is not installed, the current archive III
utilization is reported as "N/A".
Testing
-------

To test this function a fully operational RPG must be running.  The test tool
"load_shed" can be used to set the various load shed category current
utilization levels below and above the warining and alarm levels.
