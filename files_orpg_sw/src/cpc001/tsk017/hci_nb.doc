This file contains information about the HCI Product Distribution Comms Status
task.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is
designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data
stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Product Distribution Comms Status task was created as a sub task in the HCI
family of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the
"Comms" pushbutton in the USERS container or by selecting the connection between
the RPG and USERS containers in the RPG Control/Status window.  However, as 
stand-alone application, it can be launched from the command line using the
"hci_nb" command or by invoking a system call in any other application wishing
to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of benefits which are
described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The Product Distribution Comms Status task provides functionality provided by
the "NARROWBAND CONTROL", "RECONFIGURATION CONTROL", "VIEW CONFIGURATION",
"DIAL-IN PORT CONTROL EDIT SCREEN", and "AUTHORIZED DIAL-IN USERS SCREEN" menus
in the legacy UCP.  A full description can be found in the man page hci_nb(1).

There is a requirement to restrict editing of certain portions of the Product
Distribution Comms Status window to the Agency level user.  Editable fields are
desensitized until the window is unlocked with a valid password.

The Product Distribution Comms Status window cannot be resized.

An advisory lock is placed on the user profiles data store ORPGDAT_USER_PROFILES
when the window is unlocked for editing.  If another instance of the task is
running and the user attempts to unlock the window for editing, a warning popup
is displayed indicating the data are being edited by another user.  When the
window is locked, the advisory lock is removed.

Other than the RPG Control/Status task, this task is probably the most
complicated HCI familt task.  Status and adaptation data which are presented
in the windows come from a variety of sources and edits, in many cases, need
to be applied to multiple data sources.  The major data stores affected by this
task are ORPGDAT_USER_PROFILES and ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO.

Each dedicated and dial-in line must be defined in the "comms_link.conf" and
"user_profiles" configuration files.  An entry for each line is displayed in
the Product Distribution Lines container.  If new lines are added, the RPG
should be shutdown and restarted.

The dial-in users list has been broken up into pages to make the display and
updates more efficient.  Items in the dial-in list are sorted by increasing
user ID.  The sort is done AFTER edits are saved.

The timer procedure is activated in 2 second intervals.  The contents of the
Product Distribution Comms Status window are updated under the following
conditions:

	The comms relay state changes (FAA Redundant)
	Line info has been updated
	User status has changed
	
Testing
-------

To test the full thread, a fully operational RPG needs to be running with 
multiple dedicated and dial-in lines so that different users and classes can be
tested.
