This file contains information about the HCI Environmental Data Editor task.
It is intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed
rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores
and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Environmental Data Editor task was created as a sub task in the HCI family
of tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the "Environ
Data" icon pushbutton in the Applications region of the RPG Control/Status 
window.  However, as a stand-alone application, it can be launched from the
command line using the "hci_wind" command or by invoking a system call in any
other application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of
benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The Environmental Data Editor task includes the environmental data functionality
provided by the legacy UCP "Environmental Data", "Hail Temperatures/Default
Storm Motion" and "Environmental Winds Edit Screen" menus.  The top level window
contains several control buttons and a graphical presentation of the storm
motion, hail temperature heights and environmental winds data.  A full
description can be found in the man page hci_wind(1).

The default storm motion and hail temperature height data are algorithm
adaptation data and can also be found in the HCI Algorithms window.  The
environmental winds data are state data which gets initialized by a clean
start.  The "Data Entry" button creates a window in which all environmental
data are presented textually and can be edited.

Although the Guidance on Adaptable Parameters handbook specifies Agency level
of change authority (LOCA) to edit the winds data and URC LOCA to edit the
hail and default storm motion parameters, it was decided early on during the
design stage to not require a password to edit these data.  The primary reason
was that the legacy UCP required no password to edit these data.

The window can be resized in any direction.  No limits are imposed as to the
minimum and maximum sizes.

When the user edits the winds profile, he/she changes direction and speed
values separately.  When the user saves their edits, only levels where both a
direction and speed are defined are saved.  Otherwise, the direction and speed
values are set to the missing data value.

The timer procedure is activated in 1 second intervals.  The windows are
updated under the following conditions:

	Environmental winds data updated
	Algorithm data updated
