This file contains information about the HCI RPG Base Data Display task.  It is
intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather
than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events
used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RPG Base Data Display task was created as a sub task in the HCI family of
tasks.  A typical user would normally activate it by selecting the "Base Data"
icon pushbutton in the Applications region of the RPG Control/Status window.
However, as a stand-alone application, it can be launched from the command line
using the "hci_basedata" command or by invoking a system call in any other
application wishing to launch it.  This modular approach has a number of
benefits which are described in the doc file for the hci task (hci.doc).

The RPG Base Data Display task provides functionality not directly provided by
the legacy UCP.  It was developed to provide the RPG operator a way to look at
the real time data stream that is used as input to the meteorological
algorithms.  The raw RDA radial data are not displayed by this task. The raw
radial data are first processed by the velocity dealiasing algorithm.  A full
description can be found in the man page hci_basedata(1).

The RPG Base Data Display window can be resized.

The VCP label and VCP elevation cut selection buttons dynamically update
when the VCP of the input data stream changes.

The maximum zoom factor is 32:1.

There are two display modes supported: Dynamic, and Static.  In Dynamic mode
radials are painted as soon as they are output by the process base data task.
When a new elevation cut is detected (one where there is an actual change in
elevation), the window is cleared before new radials are painted.  In Static
mode, data for the selected elevation cut angle are displayed after the window
is cleared.  Static data are read from the RPG replay database.

If the grid overlay radio button is selected, a grid is displayed in two ways.
In Dynamic mode, the grid is displayed after the window is cleared but before
any new radials are painted.  In Static mode, the grid is displayed after the
window is cleared and the radials for the selected elevation cut are painted.

The map overlay radio buttons do nothing at this time.

The timer procedure is activated in 1/2 second intervals.  It dynamically
updates the display when the display mode is dynamic.  In this case, new
radials are read until there are no more to read.  If the elevation cut changes
then the display region is cleared before new radial data are displayed.

Testing
-------

To test this function fully, RDA radial data are required.  This can be
accomplished by either a live RDA, the RDA simulator, of playing back data
from tape using the "read_nexrd_tape" tool (see the man page read_nexrd_tape(1)
or an equivalent.  Data should be written to the RDA response linear buffer
(typically "~/data/ingest/resp.0").
