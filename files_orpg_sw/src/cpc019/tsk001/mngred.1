NAME 
     mngred - The ORPG redundant manager


SYNOPSIS 
     mngred [options]


DESCRIPTION

Note:  All discussions in this man page pertain to FAA redundant configurations
except where it is explicitly stated that NWS redundant configurations apply.

The mngred process manages the channel status and maintains channel synchronization
between the two channels in FAA and NWS redundant configurations. The redundant 
configuration type (ie. FAA redundant or NWS redundant) is read from the 
adaptation data during process initialization.  

Static configuration file "redundant.cfg" is used to identify all the linear 
buffers and message ids within the linear buffers that the redundant manager is 
responsible for managing. This file is separated into three main sections which 
are identified by the keys "hostnames", "Adaptation_data" and "State_data". The 
first section, hostnames, is used only in a LAN development/test environment and 
is not used in an operational system. The other two sections are used in an 
operational environment and contain the data ids (the linear buffer numerical 
identifiers) and the redundant relevant message ids in each linear buffer that the 
redundant manager manages. (A message is a data segment within a linear buffer and 
is the smallest granularity in which data can be managed.) When data is copied from 
one channel to the other, it is copied one message at a time. If all messages in a 
linear buffer are to be copied, then the message id is set to -1 in the redundant.cfg 
configuration file.  

Adaptation Data is changed by the operator through the HCI or through the RMS. Adaptation 
Data is allowed to be changed only in the following conditions: on the active channel 
at anytime; when both channels are inactive; or when the RPG/RPG link is down. When 
Adaptation Data updates occur, the mngred process is notified of the changes via LB 
notification. If the updates occur on the active channel and the RPG/PRG link 
is up, the updated LB messages are automatically copied to the other channel. If the 
RPG/RPG link is down and Adaptation Data is changed on the active channel, then all 
Adaptation Data are copied from the active channel to the inactive channel when the RPG/RPG 
link reconnects. This ensures that all Adaptation Data on both channels are synchronized 
after recovering from a RPG/RPG link break. Adaptation Data is allowed to be changed on 
the inactive channel if both channels are inactive or if the RPG/RPG link is down. When 
inactive channel Adaptation Data is changed, the Adaptation Data Updated Time is updated 
for that channel but the redundant manager does not flag the changed LB message for 
inter-channel updating. As a result, automatic updates will not occur from an inactive 
channel. The only way an inactive channel can update the other channel is for the other 
channel to be inactive, the RPG/RPG link is up, and the operator selects the Adapt Times 
box on the RPG Control/Status window. The selection of the Adapt Times box forces all 
Adaptation Data to be copied to the other channel.  Special care must be taken when 
modifying Adaptation Data on an inactive channel as it is easy for the modifications to 
be overwritten by the other channel and lost.

State Data is data that affects RDA characteristics. The primary State Data is VCP data 
(ie. VCP number, PRF selections, etc.) that is selected and downloaded to the RDA. When VCP 
data is downloaded on the active channel, the inactive channel is automatically notified of 
the VCP data that was downloaded. The inactive channel then initiates the download to its RDA. 
This ensures that the RDAs maintain a level of synchronization pertaining to the most recent 
VCP data used on the active channel. When a channel switchover occurs, the last VCP data 
used on the channel that was active is the first VCP data used by the channel switching to 
active. Other State Data that is managed by the redundant manager is PRF Selection and Spot 
Blanking. These settings are managed manually and are updated on a periodic basis instead of 
being copied to the inactive channel only when their states change on the active channel. If 
the RPG/PRG link is down, all changes in State Data are retained on the active channel until 
the link reconnects, then the most recent State Data is copied to the inactive channel.

In NWS configurations, the redundant manager is responsible for monitoring the downloads of the
Clutter Filter Bypass Map and Clutter Censor Zones to the RDA. When a channel switchover occurs, 
the redundant manager is responsible for ensuring that these two components are downloaded
to the RDA that switched to controlling if they were downloaded before the switchover occurred.


OPTIONS:

     -n specifies number of messages in the task LE log (default 1000)
     -v sets the verbose level (range: 0 - 3). Different levels are:
        0:  Operational setting            
        1:  Not Used            
        2:  UIT/DTE Testing            
        3:  Debugging/Analysis
