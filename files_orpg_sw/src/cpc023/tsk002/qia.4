NAME:
        Dual Pol Base and Quality

DESCRIPTION :
        The Dual Pol Base and Quality linear buffer contains processed dual
        polarization data identical to that output by the DP preprocessor
        (dpprep) but with a quality index value for each radial bin and 
        for each of the following data fields:  processed horizontal
        reflectivity, processed differential reflectivity, correlation
        coefficient corrected for noise, signal-to-noise ratio in the
        horizontal channel, processed specific differential phase and
        processed differential phase.

        Radials in this linear buffer are formatted using the Generic_
        moment_t structure defined in generic_basedata.h.
