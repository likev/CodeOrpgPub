NAME:
       qia

DESCRIPTION :
        Quality Index Algorithm - Part of the Dual Polarization
        implementation, this algorithm ingests radials from the Dual Pol
        preprocessor (dpprep) and computes at every bin a measure of data
        quality for each of the dual pol data fields.  This "quality index"
        can range from zero (lowest quality) to 1.0 and is intended to guage
        the radar signal's vulnerability to attenuation, non-uniform beam
        filling effects, magnitude of the correlation coefficent and signal-
        to-noise ratio.  The quality index is used by the Hydrometeor 
        Classification Algorithm to help in determining the hydrometeor type
        for each radar bin.
