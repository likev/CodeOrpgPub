        hca 

DESCRIPTION :
        The dual-polarimetric Hydrometeor Classification 
	Algorithm (HCA) is used to identify the type of 
 	target (both meteorological and non-meteorological)
	detected for specific sample volume. Target identification
	is made through the use of a fuzzy logic scheme which
        is described in detail in HCA AEL.
