This file contains information about the RPG Alert Threshold family of 
functions contained in liborpg.  It is intended to be used by those interested
in how the software is designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed
information about data stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Alert Threshold family of functions provide a common interface to manage
alert threshold data.  It is important that RPG tasks use this interface to
modify alert threshold data since two copies are maintaned in order to support
ORPG and legacy data stores.  The library ensures that both copies are
synchronized.

All Alert Threshold functions begin with "ORPGALT".  The configuration file
"alert_threshold" contains descriptions for each category and group.  Refer to
the documentation for "alert_threshold" for detailed information of alert
threshold configuration data.

The maintenance task mnttsk_alerting is used to initialize the alert threshold
data from configuration file.
