DESCRIPTION

The ORPGSAILS family of functions provide an API to reading the 
SAILS Status message (SAILS_STATUS_ID) component of the General 
Status Message (ORPGDAT_GEN_STAT_MSG) LB as well as providing 
other SAILS related information.

ORPGSAILS_read_status() is used to read the SAILS Status message
from the General Status Message LB.  Normally, this function is 
invoked internally when a call is made to one of the get functions 
and an internal flag is set indicating the message needs to be 
initialized or updated.

ORPGSAILS_read_request() is used to read the SAILS Request message 
from the General Status Message LB.  Normally, this function is 
invoked internally when a call is made to one of the get functions 
and an internal flag is set indicating the message needs to be 
initialized or updated.

ORPGSAILS_write_status() is used to write the SAILS Status message 
to the General Status Message LB.  Normally, this function is invoked 
internally when a call is made to the ORPGSAIL_set_num_cuts() function.

ORPGSAILS_write_request() is used to write the SAILS Request message 
to the General Status Message LB.  Normally, this function is invoked 
internally when a call is made to the ORPGSAIL_set_req_num_cuts() 
function.

ORPGSAILS_io_status() returns the status of the last SAILS Status 
message read or write operation.

ORPGSAILS_get_status() returns the current SAILS status.  The status 
has values GS_SAILS_DISABLED, GS_SAILS_INACTIVE (SAILS enabled but 
VCP does not support SAILS) and GS_SAILS_ACTIVE (SAILS enabled and 
VCP supports SAILS).  On error, -1 is returned.

ORPGSAILS_get_num_cuts() returns the number of SAILS cuts in the 
currently executing VCP or if the RDA is in Standby, the last VCP
to execute.   On error, -1 is returned.

ORPGSAILS_get_req_num_cuts() returns the number of SAILS cuts 
requested to be used for a SAILS VCP or 0 is SAILS is disabled.   
This function is intended to be called from a man-machine interface 
to view the number of requested SAILS cuts to be used for SAILS-enabled 
VCPs.  The value returned changes in response to the number of SAILs 
cuts requested via calls to ORPGSAILS_set_req_num_cuts().  On error, 
-1 is returned.

ORPGSAILS_get_max_cuts() returns the global maximum number of SAILS 
cuts.  The actual maximum may be site-specific.  On error, -1 is 
returned.

ORPGSAILS_get_site_max_cuts() returns the site maximum number of 
SAILS cuts.  Returns -1 on error.

ORPGSAILS_allowed() returns 1 is SAILS allowed for the current VCP, 
0 if SAILS not allowed for the current VCP or -1 on error.

ORPGSAILS_set_req_num_cuts( int num_cuts ) sets the number of SAILS 
cuts based on the value passed.  If num_cuts is 0, SAILS is disabled.  
If num_cuts is greater than the site maximum number of SAILS cuts, -1 
is returned.  This function then updates the number of SAILS cuts in 
the SAILS Request Message.  If the write fails, -1 is returned.  This 
function is intended to be called from a man-machine interface when 
selecting SAILS enable/disable or number of SAILS cuts to be used for 
SAILS-enabled VCPs.  

ORPGSAILS_set_num_cuts( int num_cuts ) sets the number of SAILS cuts 
actually in use for the current volume.  This function updates the 
number of SAILS cuts in the SAILS Status Message.  If the write fails, 
-1 is returned.

ORPGSAILS_init() is intended to be called from a maintenance task.  
It initializes the SAILS Status Message.  

EXAMPLES

The following code segment is used to retrieve the current ORPG operational
mode.

	#include <orpgsails.h>
	.
	.
	int status;
	.
	.
	mode = ORPGSAILS_get_status();
	.
	.
