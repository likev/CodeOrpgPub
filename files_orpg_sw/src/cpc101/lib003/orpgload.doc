This file contains information about the RPG Load Shed family of functions
contained in liborpg.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how
the software is designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed
information about data stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Load Shed family of functions provide a common interface to manage load
shed threshold and status data.  It is important that RPG tasks use this
interface to modify load shed threshold and status data since load shed boundary
checking is done in the library.  If a load shed threshold boundary is crossed,
the library generates the appropriate system status log messages.

All Load Shed functions begin with "ORPGLOAD".  The configuration file
"load_shed_table" contains descriptions for each category along with their
warning and alarm threshold values.  Refer to the documentation for 
"load_shed_table" for detailed information of load shed configuration data.

The maintenance task mnttsk_loadshed is used to initialize the load shed
threshold and status data from configuration file.

Log message generation is currently commented out for the CPU load shed
category.
