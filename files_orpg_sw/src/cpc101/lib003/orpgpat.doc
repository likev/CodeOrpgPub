This file contains information about the RPG Product Attributes family of
functions contained in liborpg.  It is intended to be used by those interested
in how the software is designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed
information about data stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Product Attributes family of functions provide a common interface to manage
product attributes data.  All RPG products must be defined in this table so
that this information can be used by all RPG applications

All Product Attributes functions begin with "ORPGPAT".  The configuration file
"product_tables" contains descriptions for each product.  Refer to the
documentation for "product_attributes" for detailed information of product
attributes data.

The maintenance task mnttsk_prod_gen is used to initialize the internal product
attributes data from configuration file.
