NAME

orpgprq - ORPGPRQ (product request processing) Library Functions

SYNOPSIS

#include <orpg.h>
#include <orpgprq.h>


int ORPGPRQ_get_requested_elevations (int vcp, 
			short ele_req, int elevs_size, short *elevs);

DESCRIPTION

ORPGPRQ is a module in library ORPG that provides shared functions for 
processing product request messages. 

ORPGPRQ_get_requested_elevations returns the list of requested elevations
specified by the elevation request parameter of the product request message.
The function takes the VCP number (argument "vcp"), the elevation request 
parameter (argument "ele_req") as input. The caller provides the buffer "elevs"
of size "elevs_size" for returning the elevations. The returned elevations are
of type short and in .1 degrees. They can be negative, 0 or positive.
ORPGPRQ_get_requested_elevations returns the number of elevations returned in
"elevs". In case a single elevation is requested, the function returns the
VCP elevation angle that is the nearest to the requested elevation.

The function returns -1 in one of the following failure conditions: "ele_req"
is not a valid elevation specification; Failed in retrieving the elevations
angle for the specified VCP if the VCP elevation table is needed; The number of
VCP elevations is larger than expected limit (MAX_ELEVATION_CUTS);"elevs_size"
is too small. When requesting the lowest number of cuts and the specified
number of cuts is larger than the total number of cuts, all available cuts are
returned (This is not considered as an error).
