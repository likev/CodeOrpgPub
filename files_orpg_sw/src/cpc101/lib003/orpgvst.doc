This file contains information about the RPG Volume Status family of functions
contained in liborpg.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how
the software is designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed
information about data stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Volume Status family of functions provide a common interface to manage 
the volume status message (VOL_STAT_GSM_ID) component o the general status
message (ORPGDAT_GEN_STAT_MSG).

The Process Base Data (pbd) is the task responsible for updating the volume
status message.  Other RPG applications read this message.  This message
contains information specific to the volume currently being processed.  For
mor information refer to the man page orpgvst(3).

All Volume Status functions begin with "ORPGVST". 

The maintenance task mnttsk_gsm is used to initialize the Volume Status data.
