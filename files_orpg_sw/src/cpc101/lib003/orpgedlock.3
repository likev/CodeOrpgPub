NAME
orpgedlock - Library routines used by ORPG to lock and unlock linear buffers
used to control editing by multiple processes.

SYNOPSIS

        #include <orpgedlock.h>

        int ORPGEDLOCK_get_edit_status(int data_id, LB_id_t msg_id)

        int ORPGEDLOCK_set_edit_lock(int data_id, LB_id_t msg_id)

        int ORPGEDLOCK_clear_edit_lock(int data_id, LB_id_t msg_id)

        int ORPGEDLOCK_check_update_status(int data_id, LB_id_t msg_id)

        int ORPGEDLOCK_set_write_lock(int data_id, LB_id_t msg_id)

        int ORPGEDLOCK_clear_write_lock(int data_id, LB_id_t msg_id)


DESCRIPTION :

        The orpgedlock library routines are used to control multiple edits for
        adaptation data linear buffers. The routines allow users to check
        whether or not a process has placed a lock on a particular linear
        buffer or message. The routines set and clear different kinds of locks.
        The library also checks to see if a linear buffer has been updated by
        another process while a lock was in place.
