This file contains information about the RPG Alert Threshold family of 
functions contained in the ORPG library (liborpg).  It is intended to be used
by those interested in how the software is designed rather than by a typical
user.  More detailed information about data stores and events used by this
task is presented.


Design
------
The Alert Threshold family of functions provide a common interface to manage
alert threshold data.  It is important that RPG tasks use this interface to
modify alert threshold data.  An advisory data locking mechanism exists in the
the library to help preserve data integrity.

All Alert Threshold functions begin with "ORPGALT".  The DEA file
"alert_table.dea" contains the default alerting data.  The include file
"alert_threshold.h" contains descriptions of the data structures used to store
the alerting category data.  


Source Files
------------

      of liborpg.
