NAME
orpgcmp - ORPG Library Compression Support (CMP) routines

SYNOPSIS

#include <orpg.h>

int ORPGCMP_compress( int code, char *src, int src_len,
                      char **dest);
int ORPGCMP_decompress( int code, char *src, int src_len,
                      char **dest);


OVERVIEW
The functions are described separately below.

NAME
ORPGCMP_compress()

SYNOPSIS
#include <orpg.h>

int ORPGCMP_compress( int code, char *src, int src_len, 
                      char **dest)

DESCRIPTION
Given the compression "code", the data in the source buffer "src" of
length "src_len" bytes is compressed.  The compressed data is stored
in buffer "dest" allocated by the library.  A ORPGCMP_hdr_t structure 
is prepended to the data.

If for some reason the data is not or can not be compressed (e.g., 
data buffer too small or some internal compression error), the data 
is copied to "dest" buffer without the ORPGCMP_hdr_t header. 

RETURNS
The size of the compressed buffer (include ORPGCMP_hdr_t header) or 
negative error value on error.


NAME
ORPGCMP_decompress()

SYNOPSIS
#include <orpg.h>

int ORPGCMP_decompress( int code, char *src, int src_len, 
                        char **dest)

DESCRIPTION
Given the compression "code", the data in the source buffer "src" of
length "src_len" bytes is decompressed.  The decompressed data is stored
in buffer "dest" allocated by the library.  

RETURNS
The size of the decompressed buffer (include ORPGCMP_hdr_t header) or 
negative error value on error.  On error, the data is not decompressed.
