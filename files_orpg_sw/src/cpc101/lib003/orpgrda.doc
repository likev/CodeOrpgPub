This file contains information about the RPG RDA Status family of functions
contained in liborpg.  It is intended to be used by those interested in how the
software is designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed information
about data stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RDA Status family of functions provide a common interface to manage RDA
status data.  All RPG tasks needing information on the current RDA status
should use this API.

When RDA status messages are sent to the RPG, they are processed by the
control_rda task at the RPG.  The control_rda task checks to see if the
message data is different from the previous RDA status message.  If it is,
the new message overwrites the oldest message.  In addition, RDA alarm data
is extracted and written the the RDA Alarms data store.

The maintenance task mnttsk_gsm is used to initialize the internal RDA status
message in the general status messages LB and the RDA alarms LB.
