	Originally, the ORPGADPT api was built as a simple C wrapper around the
	IOCNamedObjStore API.  Later, because save and restore functionality needed
	to operate remotely,  this API was split into client, server and shared modules.
	Also, because the static meta information contained in the adaptation data dictionary
	had a large memory footprint across all algorithms, the adaptation meta information
	was moved to the libadapt library in cpc026.  libadapt.so is now dynamically loaded
	whenever the client accesses adaptation objects.  Since the algorithms do not access
	objects, the amount of memory required for each algorithm was reduced.  To further
	reduce the algorithm memory footprint by moving the dependency on libobjcore to the
	server, work was started to RPC all functions in the api.  This work was not
	completed and the amount of gain from this is unclear.  The RPC_ADAPT define
	causes the full RPC version to be compiled instead of the object only RPC version.
	The full version has not been tested and it may not compile.



	FILE		   	DESCRIPTION
	orpgadpt.cpp		ORPGADPT functions that are not implemented in the server.
	orpgadptsv.cpp		Server functions for the ORPGADPT api.  These functions are called
				using the RSS_rpc function from other orpgadpt* modules.  For remote
				calls, the liborpg++.so library is dynamically loaded into an rssd
				server.  ORPGADPT_save, restore, install, and get_archive_name generally call
				RPC functions implemented in this server.  Some supporting functions
				are also implemented in the server.  Other ORPGADPT functions
				functions are implemented locally in orpgadpt.cpp.
	orpgadpt.h              Public prototypes for the ORPGADPT api.
	orpgadpt_def.h          Non-public functions shared by the various orpgadpt* modules.
	orpgadptc.c             RPC wrappers that call the corresponding routines in the
			        orpgadptsv.cpp module.  This includes some support routines
				for determining the local host and building RPC function
				strings.
	orpgadpt_shared.c 	C routines that are accessed from the server and client
				modules.
	orpgadpt.h (cpc000) 	Public include file for the ORPGADPT api.
