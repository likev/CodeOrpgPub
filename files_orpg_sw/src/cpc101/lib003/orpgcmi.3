NAME
    ORPGCMI_rda_request, ORPGCMI_rda_response, ORPGCMI_request, 
    ORPGCMI_response

SYNOPSIS
    #include <orpg.h>

    int ORPGCMI_rda_request ();

    int ORPGCMI_rda_response ();

    int ORPGCMI_request (int line_ind);

    int ORPGCMI_response (int line_ind);

DESCRIPTION

    ORPGCMI is the module of comm_manager interface support routines.

    The comm_manager uses data stores (LBs) for receiving requests and putting
    responses. For each communication link, the request and response data store
    IDs are deduced from their base data store IDs, ORPGDAT_CM_REQUEST and
    ORPGDAT_CM_RESPONSE, and the link's comm_manager number and user number,
    which are stored in the link configuration file (data store
    ORPGDAT_PROD_INFO, message PD_LINE_INFO_MSG_ID). Functions in this module
    are designed for conveniently retrieving the data store IDs.

    ORPGCMI_rda_request returns the data store ID for sending the requests
    to the comm_manager on the link that connects to the RDA. The returned
    data store ID can then be used to pass to ORPGDA functions as the 
    "data_id" argument. On failure, ORPGCMI_rda_request returns -1.

    ORPGCMI_rda_response returns the data store ID for receiving messages 
    (the comm_manager responses) from the link that connects to the RDA. The 
    returned data store ID can then be used to pass to ORPGDA functions as 
    the "data_id" argument. On failure, ORPGCMI_rda_response returns -1.

    ORPGCMI_request returns the data store ID for sending the requests
    to the comm_manager on the link of index "line_ind". The returned
    data store ID can then be used to pass to ORPGDA functions as the 
    "data_id" argument. On failure, ORPGCMI_request returns -1.

    ORPGCMI_response returns the data store ID for receiving messages 
    (the comm_manager responses) from the link of index "line_ind". The 
    returned data store ID can then be used to pass to ORPGDA functions as 
    the "data_id" argument. On failure, ORPGCMI_response returns -1.
