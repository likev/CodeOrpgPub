This file contains information about the RPG Product Generation Table family of
functions contained in liborpg.  It is intended to be used by those interested
in how the software is designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed
information about data stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The Product Generation Table family of functions provide a common interface to
manage product generation table data.  All RPG tasks needing information on the
current and default product generation lists should use this API.

All Product Generation Table functions begin with "ORPGPGT".  The configuration file
"product_tables" contains descriptions for each product which is contained in
the default lists.  The current list is built from the default table
corresponding to the current weather mode.  Refer to the documentation for
"product_tables" for detailed information of product attributes data.

The maintenance task mnttsk_prod_gen is used to initialize the internal product
generation table data from configuration file, "product_generation_tables".
