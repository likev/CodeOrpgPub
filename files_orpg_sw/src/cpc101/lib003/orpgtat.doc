Design
------

The Task Attributes Table family of functions provide a common interface to
manage RPG task attributes information.  RPG task attributes information are
defined in the configuration file "task"table".  This file contains information
about all tasks which are managed by the RPG manager.  Detailed information
about how the configuration file is structured can be found in the man page
task_table(4).  Task attribute information is needed so that the manage RPG
task knows which tasks to monitor.

All Task Attributes Table functions begin with "ORPGTAT".

The maintenance task iti is used to initialize the task attributes table data
from configuration file.
