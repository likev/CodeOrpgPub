This file contains information about the RPG Product Database family of 
functions contained in liborpg.  It is intended to be used by those interested
in how the software is designed rather than by a typical user.  More detailed
information about data stores and events used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RPG Products Database family of functions provide an RPG specific layer
above the database functions contained in the infrastructure library.  They
provide a more direct approach for RPG applications to query and read specific
products from the RPG Products Database.

All RPG Products Database functions begin with "ORPGDBM".  For a better
understanding of the database functionality provided in the infrastructure
library, refer to the documentation on "sdqm".
