NAME
   save_log - Collects process logs and environment data


SYNOPSIS
   save_log [options]


DESCRIPTION

Save_log is a diagnostic tool used to collect application level process
logs, system logs and environment data. The tool should be executed
whenever an abnormal condition occurs when running the application 
load, or when a connectivity problem occurs between different hosts.
Data is collected, archived to a file, compressed, and saved in directory
$HOME/save_logs. 

OPTIONS

    -a    Description (up to 25 characters) to be embedded into
          the save log file name. Only the underscore ("_")
          and alphanumeric characters are permitted. This option
          is required when creating a save log file. Strings
          longer than 25 characters are truncated.
    -c    Write the save log file to CD.
    -f    Write the save log file to floppy.
    -h    Print the usage message.
    -l    List previously created save logs for this node.
    -r    Remove previously created save logs for this node.
    -s    Suppress inclusion of root-owned files.   Otherwise,
          user is required to have sudo access.

     Note: Save logs are automatically saved to the ~/save_logs
     with the following file naming convention:
     YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS.save_log.nnnn.ch#.desc.tar.gz
     where YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS is the timestamp, nnnn is the
     node name, "#" is the channel number, and desc is
     the user-defined description.

     In addition, only the latest 10 save log files are
     kept in ~/save_logs. Older files are removed as new
     save log files are created.

EXAMPLES


     save_log -a mda_prod_failure
       - creates a save log in ~/save_logs with the string
         mda_prod_failure enbedded in the filename

     save_log -a mda_prod_failure -c
       - creates a save log in ~/save_logs with the string
         mda_prod_failure enbedded in the filename and
         writes the file to a CD

     save_log -h
       - prints the usage message
