NAME

print_log - RPG log message print script

SYNOPSIS

print_log filename

DESCRIPTION

The print_log script provides a configurable mechanism to print RPG system log
file messages.  The script can be modified to support printer specific options.
The script is very simple in that all it does is take a regular text file,
run it through the PostScript pretty printer command (mp) and pipe the output
to the lp command.  By running the text file through the mp command, long
lines are wrapped instead of truncated.  Printer specific options can be added
by modifying the script.

Options:

	NONE

NOTES

This command will accept any text file as input.  The RPG does not have to be
running.

EXAMPLES

The following example is used to print a file.

% print_log /tmp/rpg_system_log
