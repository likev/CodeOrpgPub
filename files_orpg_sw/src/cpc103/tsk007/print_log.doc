This file contains information about the RPG Print System Log script.  It is
intended to be used by those interested in how the software is designed rather
than by a typical user.  More detailed information about data stores and events
used by this task is presented.

Design
------

The RPG Print System Log script is an operational script used to send RPG
system log messages to the default printer.  The HCI RPG Status and Archive III
Control/Status tasks both use this script to print user specified system status
log messages.

In the HCI tasks mentioned, log messages are first written to the text file
"/tmp/rpg_system_log".  A system() call is then used to invoke the print_log
script using the text file as input.  The first thing done in the script is to
run the text file through the PostScript pretty print (mp) command.  This
command converts the text file into a PostScript file.  Long lines that
normally would have been truncated if the text file was sent directly to the
printer are wrapped to the next line by the mp command.  The output from the
mp command is piped to the lp command.  The lp command does not specify a
printer so the default printer is used.

If any changes are to be made to the format of the output, they should be made
to the print_log script rather to the HCI application.  This way, no compilable
code needs to be updated.


Testing
-------

All one needs to do is invoke the print_log command followed by the name of a
plain text file.
