DESCRIPTION
	This LB contains the User Selectable Layer Composite Reflectivity 
	Polar Grid(360x230) Product. 

	The product is in radial data packet format. Packet code is AF1F.
	It contains Message Header Block, Product Description Block,
	and Product Symbology Block. 

	In the Product Description Block, the first and second product 
	dependent parameters represent original bottom and top boundaries,
	respectively. The third product dependent parameter repressents 
	maximum reflectivity in this layer. The fourth and fifth product
	dependent parameters represent bottom and top boundaries
	that are actually used for internal calculation.

	The product has a coverage range of 0 to 230 km and a resolution
	of 1 km in range and 1 degree in azimuth. The internal resolution
	of each data sample is 256 levels(8 bits), but the final product
	contains 16 displayable levels(4 bits)as follows:

	  the first data level depicts data below the signal-to-noise
	  threshold;

	  the second data level depicts no data due to gaps in the VCP;

	  the third data level contains all data greater than threshold
	  and less than -5 dBZ (-32 dBZ to -5 dBZ);

	  the last data level contains all data greater than or equal to
	  55 dBZ;

	  the remaining twelve data levels depict data values greater 
	  or equal to -5 dBZ to less than 55 dBZ with 5 dBZ increment.
