NAME
cpc014 tsk011 user_sel_LRM - User Selectable Layer Composite Reflectivity Polar Grid

INPUTS
	REFLDATA - RADIAL_DATA

OUTPUTS
	ulrdata - VOLUME_DATA

BASE
	VOLUME_BASED

DESCRIPTION
	This task takes REFLDATA (79) as data input and generates 
	volume based products - ulrdata(137) for each user specified
 	layer. It handles maximum ten user requests per volume scan.
	
	User requests that contain top and bottom boundaries of a
	layer are sent to ORPG through product request message. The 
	first and second product dependent parameters are used as 
	top and bottom boundaries, respectively. The range for a boundary
	is from 0 to 70 kft above MSL. The unit is k-feet. The minimum
	thickness of a layer is 1000 feet.  
	 
	The Process_control() function is the entry point of all the 
	logic. It calls RPGC_get_customizing_data() to get user requests.
	
	Validate_boundary() is called by Process_control() to validate
	layer boudaries. The validation makes sure that all boundaries 
	are in the range from 0 kft to 70 kft. The radar's height will
	be subtracted from boundaries. The validation is just for 
	internal calculation purpose. The original boundaries user requested
	will be kept intact in ICD product description block.	

	Get_lower_upper_bins() is called by Process_control() at the 
	beginning of each new volume or elevation to determine starting
	and ending bins for each user request and every elevation cut.
	Process_radial() then projects each radial bin value to the 
	Polar_grid_buf[][][]. 

	After the data of the whole volume scan being processed, 
	Process_control() calls Assemble_ICD() to assemble the final
	ICD products for each user request. 

	Build_sym_block() constructs the symbology block for each ICD
	product. Finish_pdb() finishes the rest part of the Product 
	Description Block. In PDB, the first product dependent parameter
	is for original bottom boundary, the second product dependent
	parameter is for original top boundary, the third parameter is
	for maximum reflectivity in this layer, the fourth and fifth
	product dependent parameters are for the actual bottom and top
	boundaries used for internal calculation.
