NAME:
        cpc014/tsk017 - Dual Pol Precipitation 4 bit products generator

DESCRIPTION:
        Dual Pol Precipitation 4 Bit Product Algorithm - dp_precip_4bit
        ingests a long term accumulation buffer, DP_LT_ACCUM,
        and produces two 4 bit products:

        OHAPROD, a One Hour Accumulation, and
        STAPROD, a Storm Total Accumulation.

        OHAPROD is made from the DP_LT_ACCUM bias applied hourly grid, and
        STAPROD is made from the DP_LT_ACCUM storm total grid.

        Both products are run-length encoded using the corresponding PPS
        color table. STAPROD presents adaptation data in a TAB block.

TASK ID:
       1417

DATA IN:
       DP_LT_ACCUM (411)

DATA OUT:
       OHAPROD (169)
       STAPROD (171)
