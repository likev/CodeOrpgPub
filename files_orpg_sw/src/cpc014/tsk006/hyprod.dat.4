NAME
HYPROD.DAT - Precipitation Products Internal Data Base File

FILETYPE
Disk File

DESCRIPTION
The legacy file is implemented in the ORPG as a disk file.

This file is maintained and used by cpc014 tsk006 prcpprod (Precipitation
Products).

Legacy RPG I/O for this file is supported by replacement ANSI 77 code
placed directly in the legacy Fortran source files.

The disk file is opened as a direct-access file with a record length that
corresponds to the largest I/O performed by the legacy RPG code (82,800
bytes).

The legacy RPG file a313h.inc has been modified to provide record numbers
that are passed as arguments to the ANSI 77 READ and WRITE routines.

The structure of the file is as follows (refer to a313h.inc and the legacy
RPG routines listed below):

                                                Length
        Record                                  (bytes)
        -----------------------------------     -------
         1 Header record                           256
         2 Polar grid of Hourly Precip Accum    82,800
         3 Polar grid of Hourly Precip Accum    82,800
         4 Polar grid of Hourly Precip Accum    82,800
         5 Polar grid of Storm Total data       82,800
         6 Encoded (RLE) 3-hr Sum of Accum      53,824
         7 DPA Product Database                  2,998

Since each record is 82,800 bytes in length, we are "wasting" 191,322
bytes of this 579,600 byte disk file (33%) with this approach.

Refer to the following legacy RPG routines:

         A31468__PDB_IO
         A314M6__HYDROMET_PRODUCT_MAIN
