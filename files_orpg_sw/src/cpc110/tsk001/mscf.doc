mscf.doc				NOTES			   mscf.doc

	   Most of the functionality in the mscf application is driven by the
        commands in the mscf1.conf(4) or mscf2.conf(4)
        configuration file(s).  The configuration files provide commands
  	to start various GUI applications, report power outlet status
 	information, report comm status information, reboot power outlets,
	and gracefully shutdown workstations.  Hardware trap information is
        read from the trap.log file in the ORPG log file directory.  (Refer
	to le.3 for information about the ORPG log directory).  Traps are
	written to the trap.log by a 3rd party SNMP application (snmptrapd.1).
	   Power status commands are executed every 10 seconds to obtain the
	status of each power outlet.  Comm status commands are executed
	when the user requests status information for each comms device.
        Hardware trap information is checked every second for possible updates.
	Below is a list of descriptions for each file in the mscf application
	directory.
