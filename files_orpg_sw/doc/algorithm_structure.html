         Part A. Introduction
      </h3>
      <p>
         For an algorithm to function correctly in an operational WSR-88D ORPG,
         the API must be used correctly which includes following a basic
         logical structure. The previous section covered rules for using the
         individual API services. This section places this guidance in the
         context of a logical structure of an algorithm and provides sample
         algorithms that follow that structure. Part B provides guidance for
         initialization of data driven algorithms and event driven algorithms
         and inter dependencies on the type of algorithm loop control. Part C
         provides guidance for basic algorithms that product one output
         product. This section covers the logic after passing the control loop
         in data driven algorithms or prior to returning from event handlers in
         event driven algorithms. Part C provides additional guidance for
         algorithms producing more than one product, and Part D. covers
         algorithms that use input parameters contained in a request message.

      <p>
         This portion of the document is a summary of basic rules for using the
         algorithm registration and initialization routines and determining
         which form of the algorithm control loop function to use. Complete
         guidance for using individual API service calls is contained in
         Section II of this document.

      <h3>
         <i>Rules for Data Driven Algorithms</i>
      </h3>
      <p>
         Virtually all of the existing WSR-88D algorithms are dependent on the
         flow of internal WSR-88D data and generally produce elevation or
         volume based output. There are a few types of internal message
         products that are produced on demand but their input data is either
         elevation based or volume based. &nbsp;
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Data driven algorithms use either <tt><b>RPGC_wait_act</b></tt> or
            <tt><b>RPGC_wait_for_any_data</b></tt> form of the control loop
            function.&nbsp;
         </li>
         <li>
            Data driven algorithms must be registered for at least one product
            input and one output product.&nbsp; Data driven algorithm may also
            register for "external" events.
         </li>
         <li>
            There are two classes of data driven algorithms 
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Algorithms with a driving input. These algorithms block until
                  a specific input is available (the first input if more than
                  one is registered) and use <tt><b>RPGC_wait_act</b></tt> for
                  blocking. Each data input is accomplished with an individual
                  calls to <tt><b>RPGC_get_inbuf</b></tt>
               </li>
               <li>
                  Algorithms with no driving input. These algorithms block
                  until any one of several inputs is available and use
                  <tt><b>RPGC_wait_for_any_data</b></tt> for blocking. The
                  available input is read with a call to
                  <tt><b>RPGC_get_inbuf_any</b></tt>.
               </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            The task initialization function, <tt><b>RPGC_task_init</b></tt>,
            must follow all registrations for input / output data and
            adaptation data.
         </li>
         <li>
            The task timing type registered by <tt><b>RPGC_task_init</b></tt>
            is normally <tt><b>ELEVATION_BASED</b></tt> if output products are
            <tt><b>ELEVATION_DATA</b></tt> and <tt><b>VOLUME_BASED</b></tt> if
            output products are <tt><b>VOLUME_DATA</b></tt>. Task timing cannot
            be <tt><b>EVENT_BASED</b></tt> for data driven algorithms.
         </li>
         <li>
            If the input data is <tt><b>RADIAL_DATA</b></tt>, currently only
            base data, it is the only product data input to the algorithm.
         </li>
         <li>
            With multiple data inputs, they are generally all
            <tt><b>ELEVATION_DATA</b></tt> or <tt><b>VOLUME_DATA</b></tt>
         </li>
         <li>

      <h3>
         <i>Rules for Event Driven Algorithms</i>
      </h3>
      <p>
         There is actually no reason to use an event driven algorithm to create
         products based upon WSR-88D data. This guidance is provided for
         special applications not synchronized with the internal data flow of
         WSR-88D data.&nbsp;

         Part C. Basic Algorithms producing one Product
      </h3>
      <h3>
         <i>Rules for the Structure of Basic Algorithms</i>
      </h3>
      <p>
         The following rules for the basic logical structure of an algorithm
         must be followed to function correctly in an operational WSR-88D ORPG.
         These rules are not published but are derived from the structure of
         legacy FORTRAN algorithms and from the documentation for the porting
         library (librpg). These rules are depicted via a flow chart contained
         in this <img src="pdf_small.gif" border="0" alt="" width="16" height=
         "16"> PDF&nbsp;<a href="algorithm_flow.pdf" target=
         "algorithm_data_flow">document</a>. There is one flow chart for an
         elevation based product and one for a volume based product. Many of
         the named activities in these flow charts correspond to specific API
         services. The flow chart for the elevation product can be compared to
         the source code of the digital reflectivity sample algorithm. Comment
         labels have been placed in the source code as an aid in relating the
         source code to the flow chart.
      </p>
      <p>
         It should be noted that a task may run and produce a valid product
         even though some of these rules are not followed. However, the
         algorithm would not be correctly integrated into the ORPG. Not
         properly structuring an algorithm (following these guidelines) could
         result in unexplained behaviour. For example an algorithm task that
         crashed upon a commanded volume restart.
      </p>
      <p>
         Additional rules for using the API services are described in Section
         II of this guide titled, <em>Getting Started with the Algorithm
         API</em>, which should be read before studying the sample algorithms.
      </p>
      <h4>
         Returning to the beginning of the control loop.
      </h4>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Data driven algorithms must always return to the beginning of the
            control loop (either <tt><b>RPGC_wait_act</b></tt> or
            <tt><b>RPGC_wait_for_any_data</b></tt>) upon successful product
            output and when output is not successful (product abort).
         </li>
         <li>
            With event driven algorithms, the same principles apply. The two
            legacy event driven algorithms have all of the algorithm logic in
            the event handler function. In this case the event handler function
            must return upon successful product output and when the output is
            not successful (product abort) and the algorithm control loop
            function <tt><b>RPGC_wait_for_event</b></tt> is placed in a
            continuous loop.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
         Release all acquired buffers.
      </h4>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Before returning to the control loop (or returning from the event
            handler), all input buffers successfully obtained must be released
            with <tt><b>RPGC_rel_inbuf</b></tt> and all output buffers
            successfully obtained must be released with
            <tt><b>RPGC_rel_outbuf</b></tt>. <b><font color=
            "#990000">Note</font></b>: Attempting to release a buffer (either
            input or output) that was not obtained will cause the algorithm
            task to be terminated.
         </li>
         <li>
            With successful product construction
            <tt><b>RPGC_rel_outbuf</b></tt> is called with the
            <tt><b>FORWARD</b></tt> flag and when product construction is not
            complete the <tt><b>DESTROY</b></tt> flag is used. In addition, in
            the case of incomplete product construction one of the abort
            functions must be called.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
         Call required abort services
      </h4>
      <ul>
         <li>
            If needed moments are not available, call
            <tt><b>RPGC_abort_because( PROD_DISABLED_MOMENT )</b></tt>.
         </li>
         <li>
            If unable to successfully get an input buffer, call
            <tt><b>RPGC_abort( )</b></tt>
         </li>
         <li>
            If unable to successfully get an output buffer because of lack of
            memory (<tt><b>opstat</b></tt> = = <tt><b>NO_MEM</b></tt>), abort
            using <tt><b>RPGC_abort_because( PROD_MEM_SHED )</b></tt>. If
            unable to successfully get an output buffer for any other reason,
            abort using <tt><b>RPGC_abort( )</b></tt>.
         </li>
         <li>
            With algorithms producing more than one final product,
            <tt><b>RPGC_abort_datatype_because( &lt;datatype&gt;,
            &lt;reason&gt; )</b></tt> is called for those products not being
            produced.

      <h4>
         Resource Cleanup

      <ul>
         <li>
            All resources / allocated memory must be freed prior to returning
            to the beginning of the control loop (or returning from the event
            handler).

      <p>
         There are two purposes for these algorithms.
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            They provide a sample of algorithm structure and demonstrate use of
            the API. In addition, they can be used as templates upon which to
            build more complex algorithms.
         </li>
         <li>
            They test the API. Since there are no operational algorithms using
            the ANSI-C API, a broad population of algorithm types should be
            written in C in order to validate the C API.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         These algorithms are still being tested. Since the rules for using the
         <em>WSR-88D Algorithm API</em> are not fully understood, these
         algorithms may not meet all operational requirements.

      <h4>
         Digital Reflectivity Algorithm - Elevation Product
      </h4>
      <p>
         The CODE software includes a sample digital reflectivity algorithm.
         This is a basic algorithm that ingests base data and produces an
         elevation-based final product. No science is accomplished; the
         algorithm reads base reflectivity data and creates a graphic product
         using digital data array packet type. The base reflectivity data are
         in full resolution. This sample algorithm demonstrates the assembly of
         an ICD product with one layer consisting of a digital data array
         packet type. The digital reflectivity algorithm can be set to stop
         after processing a designated number of elevations of data. The source
         code for this algorithm is located in
         <tt><b>$HOME/src/cpc505/tsk001</b></tt>. The <a href=
         "digital_reflectivity.html">top level file</a> is provided here for
         convenience. This algorithm complies with all of the guidance in Part
         A and can be used a guide to algorithm structure.
      </p>
      <h4>
         Radial Reflectivity Algorithm - Elevation Product, 16 level RLE
      </h4>
      <p>
         The CODE software includes a sample radial reflectivity algorithm.
         This is a basic algorithm that ingests base data and produces an
         elevation-based final product. With exception of the product code
         (message code), this product is identical to the 16-level base
         reflectivity product (BREF19). This sample algorithm demonstrates the
         assembly of an ICD product with one layer consisting of a radial run
         length encoded packets. Included with the source code are reusable
         modules that have been ported from the original FORTRAN: run length
         encoding module, pad front module, pad back module and the isbyte
         module. The source code for this algorithm is located in
         <tt><b>$HOME/src/cpc505/tsk002</b></tt>. The <a href=
         "radial_reflectivity.html">top level file</a> is provided here for
         convenience. This algorithm does not comply with all of the guidance
         in Part A.
      </p>
      <p>
         NOTE: Recently, the ORPG added support the color table index for the
         ANSI-C version of the adaptation data services. This sample algorithm
         does not yet use this feature.
