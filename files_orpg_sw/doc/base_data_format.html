         Base Data Radial Message
      </h3>
      <p>
         The ORPG provides WSR-88D radar data to algorithms in the message
         format shown below. Each message represents one radial of polar
         coordinate base data.
      </p>
      <p>
         The first part of the message is the <em>Base Data Header</em> with a
         structure documented in this <a href="bdh.html">table</a>. Much of
         this information is not of interest to the algorithm developer but
         used by the ORPG infrastructure. Certain fields (flagged with "I" in
         the table) contain data that are placed into the header portions of
         the final ICD formatted product. The legacy FORTRAN algorithms access
         the message contents via an offset into the memory block. The ORPG
         infrastructure and algorithms written in ANSI-C can access the message
         via a defined structure.
      </p>
      <p>
         The actual data follow the header. The next block may contain 460
         reflectivity data values, followed by 920 velocity data values, and
         920 spectrum width data values. The size of these blocks are always
         the same though the number of valid data bins may be fewer depending
         on the range or elevation that data are sampled.

         Volumetric Structure
      </h3>
      <p>
         The volumetric structure of the data consists of multiple elevations
         of radar data with each elevation consisting of multiple base data
         radial messages. Each elevation is actually a conic section with data
         sampled at a particular elevation angle. The data are sampled using
         one of several predefined scanning strategies, called volume coverage
         patterns (VCP). At present, two VCPs are optimized for severe weather
         conditions (precipitation mode) and two are optimized for clear air
         conditions (clear air mode). The following VCPs are currently defined:

      <p>
         A detailed description of the currently defined volume coverage
         patterns can be found in Figures 40-1 through 40-4 in the B5
         Specification for CPCI-03, the Radar Product Generation Program
         (<b><i>B5-RPG</i></b>).&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
         The factors that drive the design of the scanning strategy include the
         tradeoff between unambiguous range and unambiguous velocity inherent
         in Doppler radar, the temporal and spatial scales of the
         meteorological conditions of interest, the desired precision and
         accuracy of the data obtained, and the characteristics of the specific
         radar. At elevation angles below approximately 6 degrees, the data are
         sampled with two different PRFs in order to assign the Doppler data to
         the correct surveillance echo (range unfolding). Two methods are used
         to accomplish this double sampling. Below approximately 2.5 degrees,
         this is accomplished by scanning each elevation twice (see "split
         cuts" below) in order to meet accuracy requirements and obtain
         reflectivity data to 460 km. Generally, from about 2.5 degrees through
         6 degrees this is accomplished in a "batch" mode -- the radar rapidly
         switching between a lower PRF (surveillance) and a higher PRF
         (Doppler). Above 6 degrees range unfolding is not required since there
         are generally no significant weather returns at higher altitudes. This
         means that no echoes occur at longer slant ranges at higher elevation
         angles, eliminating the ambiguity. Additional information can be
         obtained from the Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 11, Part B,
         Doppler Radar Theory and Meteorology (<b><i>FMH 11, Part B</i></b>).
      </p>
      <p>
         The manner in which the data are sampled by the radar is related to
         but differs from the manner in which the data are presented to the
         algorithms. Stated in another way, the content of the data messages
         sent to the ORPG from the radar is not the same as the base data
         radial message read by an algorithm. Other than having different
         structures and contents in the header portion of the message, the data
         content differs in two significant ways.
      </p>
      <ol>
         <li>
            Data from the RDA "split cuts" have been combined.
         </li>
         <li>
            The velocity information provided to the algorithms has been
            dealiased by the ORPG.
         </li>
      </ol>
      <h4>
         Split Cuts
      </h4>
      <p>
         In the currently defined VCPs, the lowest 2 or 3 elevations are
         scanned twice. The first scan is at a lower PRF and the base data
         messages transmitted to the ORPG include surveillance data bins
         (reflectivity data). The second scan at that elevation uses a higher
         PRF and the data messages transmitted include Doppler data bins
         (radial velocity and spectrum width data). At higher elevations the
         data are sampled in a single scan.
      </p>
      <p>
         The ORPG transforms the RDA base data messages into the ORPG base data
         messages described in this document. Algorithms interested only in
         reflectivity data register for <tt><b>REFLDATA</b></tt> input and read
         ORPG data messages created directly from the first scan of a split
         cut. Algorithms interested in velocity and / or spectrum width data
         register for <tt><b>COMBBASE</b></tt> input and read ORPG data
         messages derived from the second scan of a split cut. The ORPG data
         messages created from single scan elevation samples are read by all
         algorithms inputting base data.
      </p>
      <p>
         The ORPG base data messages derived from the second scan of a split
         cut also contain reflectivity data that has been inserted from first
         scan of that cut. This process involves selection of the first scan
         reflectivity radial message with an azimuth closest to the second scan
         azimuth. Thus, the reflectivity is "velocity mapped"; it no longer
         includes the original azimuth information. As a result, algorithms
         that are registered for <tt><b>COMBBASE</b></tt> input can process
         reflectivity data in addition to velocity and spectrum width. However,
         the reflectivity data for elevations derived from a split cut
         (inserted reflectivity data) will have a minor azimuth error.
      </p>
      <h4>
         Velocity Dealiasing
      </h4>
      <p>
         Currently, all processing of base data except velocity dealiasing is
         accomplished by the RDA. This includes: signal processing, conversion
         to meteorological units, point target suppression, suppression of data
         below a set threshold, and range unfolding. Additional information can
         be obtained from the <b><i>FMH 11, Part B</i></b>. Velocity data that
         has not been dealiased is not made available to ORPG algorithms with
         the current API.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h4>
         Elevation Characteristics
      </h4>
      <ul>
         <li>
            Currently, a volume scan strategy cannot contain more than 20
            elevations.
         </li>
         <li>
            Elevations normally consist of approximately 360 radials. The
            radial spacing is typically between 0.95 degrees and 1.1 degrees.
            Under certain conditions, an elevation could contain up to 400
            radials. Radial spacing is relatively stable for a given radar,
            however.
         </li>
         <li>
            Radials from one elevation are not aligned with radials in other
            elevations, nor do elevations begin at the same azimuth. After the
            radar antenna has repositioned to a new elevation angle, data
            sampling begins when radar parameters (including antenna
            positioning) have stabilized within specified limits.
         </li>
         <li>
            The radar pedestal positioning accuracy is &plusmn; 0.2 degrees in
            elevation and azimuth.

             Generally the RDA is set to provide the best precision of the
            velocity data (Doppler resolution 1). Under certain conditions the
            RDA is set to encode a greater range of velocities but with reduced
            precision (Doppler resolution 2).

         Data Accuracy
      </h4>
      <p>
         The accuracy of the data depends upon many factors including PRF,
         antenna rotation rate, and clutter suppression. <b><i>FMH 11, Part
         B</i></b> provides a discussion on WSR-88D radar characteristics and
         data acquisition considerations. Typical values for standard deviation
         are approximately:

      <p>
         Data are encoded in the least significant byte of a short integer.
         Value <tt><b>00</b></tt> is a flag for "Data Below Threshold". Value
         <tt><b>01</b></tt> is a flag for "Signal Overlaid" (obscured by range
         folding). The remaining 254 data values are encoded as follows:
